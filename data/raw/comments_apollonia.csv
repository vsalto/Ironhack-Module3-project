Such a trend is not only disheartening but also reflects the unfortunate truth of our current society, which is marred by a pervasive lack of honesty.\r\n\r\nThe undeniable allure of social media\'s instant gratification cannot be overlooked or contested. As a result, the perceived value of individuals has significantly declined‚Äîa harsh reality to accept, but it\'s important to face facts.

Your YouTube channel has been nothing short of a guiding light, illuminating a path towards healthier relationships and personal growth.\n\nComing from a dysfunctional family, where emotional distance was the norm, I struggled to find my way in the world of dating and relationships. The void left by the lack of a father figure and my workaholic mother's emotional unavailability led me to chase after emotionally distant partners, sacrificing my self-worth and self-esteem in the process.\n\nBut then, one fateful day, I stumbled across your channel. Your wisdom opened my eyes to the traits of a high-value man and reminded me of the importance of putting myself first. Your teachings encouraged me to value myself and work on becoming the best version of myself.\n\nThrough your invaluable advice, I learned to recognize toxic patterns in my relationships and, most importantly, to know when to respectfully walk away from those who were not worth my time and affection. Your guidance has given me the courage to be authentic in life and love, and I'm forever grateful.\n\nThanks to you, I've become a much stronger and happier individual. Your teachings saved me from a path of heartache and disappointment. I can confidently say that because of your work, I've avoided toxic relationships that could have led to a lifetime of unhappiness.\n\nI shudder to think where I would be without your guidance. If it weren't for your videos, I might have remained a hopeless romantic, endlessly giving my all to partners who didn't appreciate me, and ending up in unhealthy relationships or even a troubled marriage with children caught in the cycle of chaos.\n\nYou've given me the tools to break free from that cycle, and I know I'm not the only one. Countless souls, both present and yet to be born, owe their future happiness to you, Appolonia. Your work is shaping a brighter world by creating healthier relationships, empowering people to walk away from toxicity, and ultimately fostering happiness and fulfillment.\n\nYour impact goes beyond this generation; it extends to the generations to come. For that, I am eternally thankful. You are not just a dating and relationship expert; you are a beacon of hope, guiding lost souls like me towards a more fulfilling life.\n\nKeep doing what you do, Appolonia, and know that your efforts are profoundly changing lives and making the world a better place.

Can be the big equalizer for men to separate themselves from other men. Especially if you feel you lack the physical traits that women commonly desire in men. Adapting this points to fit the situation and the likes of the woman is key. It's starts with being totally aware of her body language and the sounds she makes. Most men don't understand the importance of foreplay starting way before the physical touch. Hours, or maybe a day before. Taking time to vocalize or communicate prior to even touching her. I've always thought that many women enjoy the foreplay much more than the actual sex. The draw back to all this is that is does take time and planning on your part. Once you do these things correctly. Your woman will expect this with every encounter. You will also notice that she really doesn't participate in this foreplay. She will expect you to be responsible for all the foreplay. As is it most always happens. It will be all on you. Not only with the physical stuff, but all other aspects in the relationship. Proving you can provide, protect, and can be open emotionally. A point that needs to be understood is few women will actually tell you what she wants verbally. A woman that expresses her desires and even talks dirty is an absolute Unicorn. It's been my experience that many will just show up and allow access. As always you either do the work that's required or you get nothing. The big thing to remember is that No man has ever decided to have sex (Legally) That's just a part of life. When all this becomes to much work and you feel these is an inequality of effort. Go MGTOW and be responsible for your own happiness.

Most women stay married and in a relationship after 40 because that is what they are used to. Society has indoctrinated them with the belief that if they leave their man, they will be judged by friends, family, and coworkers. If there are kids in the picture who are still in their teens or even younger, it makes it even more difficult to leave the man. After 40, our needs change dramatically. What women want and what men want are totally different. Men want to slow down and take it easy, while women who have been taking care of the family, the house, and the kids most of their life are getting restless. Maybe there are kids who have just moved out or are in college far away from home, leaving an open empty space for her to explore life and herself. This creates a lot of problems for men because they do not want to do much; they just want to take it easy and enjoy life at their own pace. After 40 and beyond, most men get winded just by taking a walk. Their testosterone level has started to fade, and they are not as full of stamina as they used to be. That is why a lot of relationships and marriages start to fail when both the man and the woman are in their 40s. Women start to complain and say to the man, ""You used to be fun, don\'t be so boring, let\'s go do something!"" When they were younger, they could have sex several times a day. After 40 and beyond, it is not the same, particularly if they have just eaten and depending on what they ate. Most men are incredibly patient when it comes to their wives and girlfriends, so they do what they can to make their woman happy. But men also have a limitation. They do what they can and try to change to please their woman, but nothing seems to work and nothing seems to be good enough in the long run. The truth is that men should never change for a woman. They should change for themselves. It is important to live their lives on their own terms, free from the expectations and judgments of others, especially women and what they want. Being single allows men to do that. They can focus on their own personal growth and happiness rather than trying to please someone else. When men get nothing back in a marriage or relationship, they start to feel empty. This creates an unhealthy dynamic between the man and the woman. Men have a tendency to take a lot of nagging from women, but their patience wears thin after a while. There is only so much nagging men can take; when they have had enough, it is enough. After 50 years in this life, I have learned what is important and what is not important as a man. It is better to stay true to oneself and live a fulfilling life on one\'s own terms. Men must also think about their overall health. Stress in any form can lead to so many problems. I would like to share a personal experience that has shaped my views on relationships. When I was in my twenties, I found myself in a meeting with 10 women. I was the only man in the room, and the women were all in their 40s and 50s. They were discussing their marriages and relationships over a cup of coffee. What I heard that day was shocking, to say the least, and it burned itself into my memory for the rest of my life. The women were speaking about their husbands and boyfriends, and what I heard was not pretty. They spoke of cheating, lying, and money, and the way they spoke about their partners made my jaw drop. The things I heard that day scared me and definitely impacted my dating life and my views on women in general. Some of these women were talking about going on vacations and sleeping with other men behind their boyfriends\' and husbands\' backs.\nIn that moment, I realized that if men around the world had been in that meeting, they would have thought twice about being in a relationship with a woman. One of the 10 women noticed my facial expression as they continued their trash talk about their men. She said out loud, ""Poor Mike. I hope you\'re not going to be scarred for life by listening to all this crazy talk!"" Of course, I\'m not saying that all women are like the ones I heard from that day. However, the fact is that many men out there have no clue what their women are saying about them behind their back. One important lesson I learned that day is that a lot of women stay with their men for practical and financial reasons. Please note that this experience was 25 years ago. Nowadays, we\'re seeing a new trend around the world where more women are choosing to be alone. They have their own income, and they don\'t need men in the same way as they used to in the past.', ""I can tell you guys one thing at the age of 50 I have come to learn one thing in this life.

They are strong, they don\'t need a man. They have a long list of qualifications for you to spend time with them.  Which begins the problem that 85% of men are completely invisible to women.  They have a certain physical and financial standard they expect.  The best way to treat them is as a guy friend and act like you don\'t need them. This will help you relax and enjoy the date.  Don\'t make the first date to long and don\'t spend a lot of money on the date.  This sets a precedence for all other dates.  Be excited, be funny, be engaging.  Make the conversation about her. Women love to talk about themselves.  Set your standards high men.  A woman truly doesn\'t want a man whore.  But she does want a man that all the other women want. HUH ?  I try to exchange very little personal information about myself to way into the date.  The traditional questions a woman uses to evaluate a mans possible worth comes quickly.

Yes men have some estrogen but that helps with their libido and women some testosterone, but that helps with their feminine sex drive. \n\nIf a grown man says that he has feminine energy, in the way that energy is being used here -- meaning that there is a part of his personality and attitude is naturally similar to a woman's -- then he is very confused."", ""1.

Don't drink too much alcohol, don't take drugs.  Bad for your physical and mental health. Drains your masculine energy.\n5. Stop watching porn and using it as a sexual outlet.

If I wanted to pursue this woman (and I was certainly feeling that way) I would have to face things that I had no idea how to face. There was so much pain, so much doubt, so much fear, loss, devalued self worth, guilt, etc‚Ä¶.. But here‚Äôs the thing. Although I saw all of that on the surface. What I saw inside was what grabbed my heart. She was strong. Stronger than she knew, stronger than I had ever seen. I am a man of faith. I try to focus on God and seek his plan. So I cried out and asked for direction. The answer was tenderness not romance. Compassion not lust. Respect not impatience. No way, would I ever crack this shell by thinking for myself. I had to think with her emotions. Learn triggers. See the pain and take some of it upon myself to truly understand. Sure I could do and say many things to teach her how special she is. Remind her of her beauty, her worth, value, and rarity. All of those things are great but without respect for her boundaries and what she needs to process. All would be wasted. Not long after we met. Circumstances changed and the friendship was forced into a long distance connection. To maintain the ‚Äúvibe‚Äù I became attached to talking daily. But she needed help and a time came that I could no longer provide that. When she began therapy to overcome the trauma she had endured. She slowly started pulling away. I saw it coming and knew what was happening. But I still tried my best because I was desperate to see my continued impact. Then she got new advice. The Therapist advised her to distance herself from any emotional pull from others. I was clearly in that category and I completely understood it.\n\nSo recently (the better part of two months) we haven‚Äôt had much communication. Her mother reached out to me and explained what was happening very softly and respectfully asked for space. Not just from me. From all outside connections. She had to take time to focus on herself and fall in love with herself again. So as confusing and hard as it‚Äôs been. That is what I am doing. She didn‚Äôt pull away out of anger towards any pressure I created. She just needed to focus and allow the therapy to take its place in her healing.\n\nI tell you all of that so I can give the advice that I intended. The idea of running away from her is mind boggling to me. That‚Äôs terrible advice and it should be ignored. Ask yourself how many people have already done that to her. I can give you the answer. If she has pain in her past, trust issues, or fear of a relationship. The answer is EVERYONE. Everyone has run from her at some point. That‚Äôs why shes here. If she knows your feelings. She knows your desires. Let it be and don‚Äôt go away completely until you are asked to do so.\n\nPeople ask me everyday how long I will wait for this girl. That question has two answers.\n\nAs long as it takes.\n\nor\n\nOr until I am told that I shouldn't.\n\nTry to remember these things.\n\nRESPECT (no elaboration needed)\n\nDon‚Äôt give up when she expects you to. Remember its probably her past that makes her feel like you will.\n\nYou are not the cause of her wounds.\n\nIf you love her, love her without apologizing for it.\n\nIf space is needed. Only you can provide it. Shes not going to beg for it. She will ask once, maybe twice. Failing to understand its importance will morph your fears into reality.\n\nShe will never ask you to wait. But you will do it if you think shes worth it.\n\nShe feels guilty that you‚Äôre putting your life on hold for her. Ignore that. She feels guilty about things you will never understand. Guilt is probably her most painful emotion to overcome.\n\nYou are not a band aid, so don‚Äôt act like one. Hookups are band aids. Affairs are band aids. True friends are not.\n\nEncouragement is still valuable while giving space. Send periodic messages that she doesn‚Äôt need to respond to. Do not burden her with the guilt of ‚Äúignoring‚Äù you. Remind her that you‚Äôre proud. Do what you can to leave love out of it. Just tell her she is strong and you are thinking about her. praying for her etc. Remind her that you are always there ‚ÄúIF‚Äù she needs you not ‚ÄúWHEN‚Äù. Don‚Äôt come across as assuming. (space these messages out. Don‚Äôt think daily right now, think weekly)\n\nRemember that she is probably less in love with herself than you are with her. She has to get there in order to give you or anyone the best version of her. She cannot give the broken version away. The fear of sabotage is too much. If you are good, she fears ruining you.\n\nShe wants to be heard but she will never beg for your ear. You just always have to be listening.\n\nTake the time to work on yourself. If you have fear and doubt about her. Take the time away to rid yourself of those emotions. Uproot your own darkness that is causing them.\n\nShe likely wasn‚Äôt looking for you when you arrived. You showed up out of nowhere. There are probably feelings that confuse her from the very first conversations you had. No matter how much time has passed since. Those confusing emotions still run through her mind. That‚Äôs ok. That‚Äôs likely good or she would have cut you off completely before letting you into her circle to begin with.\n\nRemember that the confusion you feel right now does not compare to hers. The time that goes by will suck. You will miss her. But there is nothing else you can do. Tell yourself everyday that you deserve her. Tell yourself that she deserves your patience. Focus on what makes you special to begin with.\n\nShe is worth it. Or you wouldn‚Äôt be here asking this question.\n\nThat‚Äôs most important thing I can say. When you tell a girl that she is worth it or she‚Äôs worth the wait. I promise you shes heard that song before. So far no one has made that true to her. No one has actually finished the song, recorded it, and gave it to her to keep. Be the guy that that completes her playlist. She has a wall that you will never completely tear down. You will remove a few bricks from time to time. But if you really like whats on the other side of that wall. You will try again and again to climb over it. When that person decides to love you she will love you so completely and faithfully that you will be glad you waited. She will not give her love away casually.\n\nStay focused. Keep climbing.\n\nThe man on top of the mountain didn‚Äôt just fall and land there.

Men just remember to keep your frame about you at all times.  Know what you want and where your going. The seduction of a woman is a long, long, long, process.  You must be on point with your actions, your appearance, and your words at all times.  Women love the game of dating.  They love being pursued and seduced because the process is 100% focused on them.  Men are under constant scrutiny and are being tested.  Keep things light and have fun with it.  Treat her with respect and kindness.  Try to build trust and an emotional connection by being present at all times with her.  Never get sexual or physical in the early stages of the process.  Look for those ever so slight signs that she wants to go further.  This physical part is the most difficult for a man. The wrong move here will end it quickly.  If your in doubt at any time. Choose to just not be physical.  Even the slightest physical contact move on her part doesn\'t mean it\'s ""Go"" time.  If she pulls away, attempt to find out what you did wrong.  Heck ask her or her girlfriends.  You know she shared it with them. This information will lead to a better outcome for you in the future.  As always the points in this video are just key points in what AP believes will create seduction in a relationship.  This does in no way means it will work on all women.

Why would a woman look for security externally or outside of herself when the truth is power comes from within?  So in other words a women needs to observe calmness in a man to find it for herself..Ok\n4.  Stress needs to be managed from within...that is why the intuitive women meditates and practice yoga...to find inner strength for themselves.  That\'s why it is called self-help. Your suppose to help yourself.\n5.  Why impose labels on yourself such as ""Alpha"" or ""Beta"" when labels are limiting?  Only self aware men and women know this.\n6.  Truth is (spiritually speaking) is that both woman and man need to embrace divinity and the masculine and feminine god or goddess that resides in us all.\n7.  You don\'t need to manage all of this.  Just be self aware.  Self Awareness has its own internal management system that is autonomous.\n8.  Your purpose in life is an inward journey.   Happiness can only be achieved from within.  Try looking for happiness externally and you create a path to get to it.  It is a long path that never ends man.  Realize that happiness in created from within yourself and you have immediate access to it.\n9.  Push and pull is a universal law, just as ebb and flow is.  Its called the Law of Polarity.

No man can cause inner strength inside of a women when she has low self worth.  Low self worth is a result of how she perceives herself but ultimately because of not knowing who she truly is.  \n15.  If you are a man and you want strength, look towards that great big ball of fire in the sky...THE SUN...a model for all men.  The Sun traverses the universe and the moon follows.  The moon would be left in total darkness, if it were not from the light of the sun.  So let your light shine(be positive).\n16.  Don\'t listen to a woman tell you how to be a man.

If you decide to stay in a relationship with him, he will downgrade you and abuse you like all the others. Because in his mind, if you love him, he thinks you are unworthy of him.

So many people have stopped loving each other and stopped connecting physically; and with physical touch. No more hugging, cuddling, caressing, or even sex.  How sad! Also, please tell me how a woman can just shut off her libido like nothing for years and stop loving, touching,  cuddling,and kissing. But what is wrong with being a woman's lifeline? How cool is that? To be even a twinkle in her eye, wow! I think that it is so awesome. Society seems to frown on clinginess, yet look at society now and see how many are not connecting with anyone. It is so sad. Look at Sweden, Finland, Estonia,etc. How sad! Men and women don't know how to interact with each other or show their emotions in a healthy way. I understand about a woman needing to get some help and a man as well. But when did connecting to each other become a bad thing. It is so beautiful to see two people holding hands and kissing; and being together; and not wanting to let go or be apart ever. That's just how I feel about it. Thanks for sharing this video!  I respect certain things that you said here. that clinginess is a love language. I believe now that I am a clingy man  and am affectionate. I like affectionate women, clingy, but not controlling.

My issue with the whole approach thing is that, no matter how much I considered it, and no matter how much expert advice I have heard, still there is no good and logical pretext to interrupt and almost certainly annoy women in a bar, club, or public setting. In the end, it is extremely difficult to ever have a circumstance where one can meet females in a non-stressful setting --- and of course, those few women you may ever encounter this way will most certainly not be the type of woman you were hoping to meet."", 'Can u help me overcome it plz I‚Äôll pay u', '""you\'re gonna get rejected a lot, and that\'s okay"" \n\nWhat the fuck are you smoking?

An interaction between two people  can trigger feelings of infatuation which may not be mutual and can be one-sided. That\'s a very possible thing. Chemistry being one-sided is in itself a moot point and goes against the laws of nature  -  you need two to make the reaction work, so chemistry is always a two-sided thing. It\'s like the expression ""it takes two to tango"". Chemistry is an equal exchange and effort being put by both parties into interactions and conversations, there is an ebb and flow and it\'s effortless because it\'s balanced. There\'s also different kinds of chemistry - sexual, conversational, intellectual etc that can happen. So of course, you need two people to create this equal exchange and balance (assuming that both are being sincere in their intentions and nobody is pretending/faking chemistry). To say chemistry is one-sided is like saying ""We were having a conversation/dialogue where he does all the talking,"" which is really a monologue, not a conversation/dialogue. It\'s where somebody is being talked at and not talked to. It\'s one-sided, that\'s infatuation.\n\nNow, I think what causes one-sided infatuation however is maybe the person who is feeling the intense one-sided feelings has been starved of this experience.

She fought cancer three times over the last 20 years of our marriage.  Life with her had ups & downs.  The big downer was that she was a pretty severe, but functional, alcoholic.

Our marriage had died somewhere at least a decade ago, but she was the mother to our son and the only one to witness my entire adult life.  They gave her two months, so we left Colorado and relocated back to our home town in central California.  We fought hard, and as a result she lasted another three years, but everything ended abruptly from the lepto meningeal cancer; in two months, she went from a solid 140 IQ to an invalid.

Before you just call me another stupid sexist hear me out real quick. \nY\'all have created a cycle of unhappiness.  As far as I\'ve seen it it was a big misunderstanding looking at the way that men live their lives and calling them ""strong and independent"", as ultimately that\'s not anything to strive for. Being independent typically leads to being incredibly self-centered and having absolutely no prospects, it tends to create very lonely people, and to pair that with the idea of strength is simply silly. It\'s very heavily pushed with a lot of the feminist kind of thing of women needing to be strong and independent, when really that\'s not a good goal for most human beings on the planet. We\'re social creatures and guys traditionally don\'t have a goal to be strong and independent, maybe some do as teenagers and young adults that aren\'t really ready to settle down and act like morons, but it\'s an incredibly impulsive and really pointless thing. Part of men growing up is them learning being strong and independent doesn\'t matter, and it\'s a lot more fulfilling to be dependable and considerate, to try to take care of and provide for other people to make their lives easier. I\'m not going to pretend like there aren\'t guys that did horrible things for their own self-interests, but all this praising of being strong and independent makes me think that this is who you\'re looking up to to model yourself after. \nA strong independent dude is the type that doesn\'t have any value for women aside from as objects, could care less about his children because that would require him to give up his independence, someone that has absolutely no value put in friends or family. \nIt really does come off as a bit condescending because this is something men have discussed among themselves for a long time.

(We weren\'t officially together but were hoping to reach that point.) He had both bipolar and dissociative identity disorder. We REALLY seemed to click when we met at a dance and in those months following. He was CONSTANTLY texting, calling and sending selfies, but I didn\'t mind because I liked him too. I knew of his disorders but 1) I have my own struggles (abusive father, anxiety, depression, avoidant personality disorder) so I didn\'t want to judge him for his; 2) he claimed (and seemed) to be managing them really well; and 3) I\'m trained in psychology, so I don\'t view people with illness with fear and stigma like I did before learning more about psychological conditions. Heck, even my channel is ABOUT psychology! I felt like a hypocrite if I rejected someone for his struggles.\n\nWe met up for ten days in his home state to be together in person and I was shocked at how different he seemed! Gone was the eager, attentive, reliable, punctual, and ope-minded man. This man was distant, dismissive, impulsive, unreliable, and closed to my interests and hobbies. He blew off many of the things we\'d talked about doing together to hang out with friends he didn\'t see that often, which I felt bad protesting that since I didn\'t feel right taking him away from friends he knew before we met. \n\nI brought up the things we talked about doing together- he said he\'d forgotten all that we\'d talked about but that all that talk had just been brainstorming anyway, he hadn\'t actually considered those to be ""plans"". That hurt A LOT... but I knew he had internal struggles and I didn\'t want to toss aside the 4-month-long connection without giving it a fair chance and hearing him out. Plus, we promised each other in August that if we had a problem, we\'d talk it over, not just toss the relationship out on a whim.\n\nAfter I got home, the next phone conversation we had, he ended it. No discussion or talking about it, just done. He gave a few reasons but many were things he already knew about me. Why had they suddenly become a problem?? I feel so hurt and betrayed that he went back on his words. \n\nAfter reflecting, it seemed the ""reasons"" were emotional impulses, which is typical for people with bipolar. I don\'t think he\'s a bad guy... but that realization doesn\'t change the practical fact that the betrayal cut deep and I\'ve lost all trust in him. Even if he later comes back and tries again, I promised myself I wouldn\'t go back. Personally, I can\'t live like that. My abusive father is a narcissist, and even though narcissism and and bipolar are not the same, this guy\'s betrayal feels a LOT like how my dad would twist words and lie to me. I won\'t be with someone whom I must constantly question or wonder if he will remember the commitments he made.\n\nI felt like I missed this guy, but then realized I didn\'t miss him.

I am feminine in that I am very emotional and dramatic, and I do not say that as a bad thing. The Lord God made me the way I am for a reason.\n\nI have no problem at all with a girl wearing high heels even if she is already taller than me. I prefer another kind of shoe, and that has nothing to do with how taller that makes the girl look; it has to do with something I have thought about since I was very young that is too personal to share online.\n\nWhat matters more to me than how tall or how short a girl is is she a Christian, and her personality, and her political views, and tastes in food, and music, and bookes, and movies. I do not mind if she is more emotionally, and physically, and spiritually mature than I am, provided she does not rub it in my face like a boy I knew once upon a time.\n\nI love children, but I have no desire to be a father because I have not the temperament to deal with a miscreant boy or girl. I also have no interest in carnal copulation because I have a bad back, and do not want to risk my back seizing up. Hugging and cuddling is as far as I am willing to go regarding intimacy with a girl. I am okay with playing musical chairs with a female friend, and if I happen to sit with her when the music stops, that is just fine with me.', 'Ya and they are all going for that 13 % women really do not like short guys they hate me watch what women do don‚Äôt listen to what they say tall men can get away with anything', '5‚Äô3 is hard', ""I believe my genetic height is significantly taller than my physical height.

Since the root neuro-immuno-endochrine disruption could not be solved at the time the sensible thing to do was to provide growth hormone before the bones could fuse and address the neuro-immuno-endochrine problem later. However, due to political reasons I was not able to get the growth hormone in time and my bones fused. So, I'm about the height of the average woman in the USA. It could be worse, but it could be better.

I met my girlfriend on a dating website two months ago. We talk on the phone for a week, then met in person twice. One week  later I asked her to be my girlfriend and she agreed. We have unbelievable chemistry with each other , enjoy hearing each others conversations, laugh all the time with each other on the phone, text messages , in person. Though when I show affection toward her and tell her that I love her. She just smiles and says thank you, instead of saying ""I love you"" back, or ""I care about you too"". Were going on two months together and she still hasn\'t told me that she loves me. The only time we talk to each other, or hang out in person is when she wants some financial help, for me to buy her food,  or some other physical thing. We never just talk to each other just to say hi and see how each others day is going. For the 1st time in our relationship , she asked how I was doing yesterday when we met up. I love and care about her, but when I can\'t help her out, she doesn\'t respond back via talk or text on phone for days. I asked her two weeks ago, to please get back to me every two-three days, so I\'m not worrying if your ok or not. Should my girlfriend\'s behavior toward me and her lack of being thoughtful about our relationship, be a concern to me? Or should I give her more time to adjust to being in a relationship with me and trying to open up and show more affection toward me. We\'ve been together for two months and she still hasn\'t told me her last name. Whenever we try to met up, she makes excuses about why she can\'\'t meet up. If we do meetup its only for like 2 hours or less on that day. She insist that work is the reason why we can\'t spend more time together. Monday through Friday is for work,  Saturday and Sunday is for her mom and sister.  Trying to find a common ground and compromise is something that she doesn\'t adjust to rite now for our relationship. It\'s her job and family, and I fit in where she has time left over. We talk about everything with each other. I just wanna know if she is indeed the women/girl I\'m suppose to be with for the long haul.

One thing I will share with your viewers,  to talk about the disrespect is to also talk about all the gifts, the things she does to get you hooked. That's the hard part. Because she knows you're not really gonna freak out over her games unless you're first, hooked. She feeds off your temporary insanity. First comes the hook, then comes the games. Example. Becky gives you a book she had lying around the house, she gave it to you in front of your boys, she smiles and walks away. You lose your effing mind in love. Please dont, just give her some old thing you have, and never think about it again. Another example, Becky is going to call you or text you back fast, next, completely unaware, she's taking her time texting you back but you still text her back in seconds. She got you. You will know the difference between the girls doing these things to hurt you, or that actually likes you by two simple facts. One, she will correct herself when she efs up, two, she will not repeat a disrespectful action after you told her to stop. If she doesn't fix her own errors, or stop disrespecting you, then she is not afraid of the consequences and she will keep effing with you until she replaces you"", ""The remedy is a male version of the same mind games. So let's say this works to some degree I have no doubt she will keep coming back to playing similar mind games with you because she has real personal trauma or character flaws that would have to be worked through for her to become more mature and stop the game playing shit.  Women aren't forced to suffer the results of there actions like men constantly are. Any time you let a person get away with bad behavior they grow more confident they can treat you even worse. Bottom line your woman tries you in this kind of way spell out your boundaries  make sure you are clear about what's ok and what will end the relationship.

She asked me in private what was going on. I confessed that I felt obligated to not say much around her so I don\'t say anything to upset or embarrass her. That, ironically, bugged her. She was all, ""That makes me feel bad. What are you trying to say? That I\'ve taken your freedom of speech? That I\'ve completely restricted your ability to be yourself? That I\'m just this controlling and ridiculously touchy girlfriend?"" Now what did I do? Did I actually say something wrong and insensitive? She told me to tell her why I was silent in her presence.

At the end of the day I would hope that things would change but they won't, nice guys are second guessed and especially at my age women run away from the men who are loyal and will treat them well. This is not the fault of women but just the world that we live in now. I appreciate you positing this but I have lost hope in our society into gravitating towards the bad and second guessing the good such as a man that will treat them well.

If she says yes, ask her to have lunch with you or see a movie sometime. Then just be yourself. If she likes you & wants to pursue a relationship, you\'ll know it\'s because she likes you for who you are, not because you followed someone else\'s stupid list of ""Things to say to melt her heart."" If she, on the other hand, turns out NOT to be the person you wanted or expected her to be, just tell her the truth and move on. If you\'re too chickensh!t to tell her the truth because you don\'t want to hurt her feelings, you have to remember that hurt feelings are a normal part of everyday life and that sometimes, truth hurts. You can soften the blow simply by telling her that you respect her enough to tell her the truth, and not give her some line of BS. And, chances are, you\'ll be HELPING her more than hurting her. BTW, about this video, most of you female coaches coaching males don\'t seem to know much about the single adult male psyche. Most of the single (and some NOT single) men (non-gay) I know are not looking to ""melt a woman\'s heart."" When we meet an attractive woman, we basically just want to hug, kiss, and make love to them. After that, maybe we become \'f*ckbuddies\' (or maybe not), or maybe get into a relationship, but either way, we don\'t want somebody who wants us to ""melt their hearts"" all the time any more than the woman wants US to be trying to ""melt"" theirs all the time. Most of the men I know can tell right away when a woman is attracted to them, and are confident enough to know how to hook up with them (if the man wants to), without resorting to some phony pre-fab list of things to say to win her over. Most of these ""coaching"" videos I\'ve seen seem to target & exploit men who are (for whatever reasons) non-confident and insecure. These lonely & troubled men don\'t need to be taught lists of ""phrases"" or ""tricks"" to get women into bed or into a relationship, they need to be taught how to be more confident and secure about who they are, and learn to share their true selves with others, not just women. THAT\'S where the focus of your ""coaching"" should be, NOT on teaching men how to be someone they\'re not by deceiving themselves and whatever woman whose heart they want to ""melt"" with somebody else\'s list of things to say. Just be yourself, Bros, and if she doesn\'t like you for who you really are, walk away and don\'t waste any more time with her. As long as YOU like who you are, that\'s what really matters. If DON\'T like who you are, work on it until you BECOME someone you like. Until you get THERE, pursuing a meaningful & happy relationship with someone else will get you nowhere. If you\'ve done that work, and have learned to love & respect yourself, and someone still rejects you, get back in the saddle & keep trying until until you find a woman who DOES love & respect who you are, and one who YOU feel the same way about. And NEVER get discouraged and give up!

The question ""What do women want?"" has been asked for many years, and the answers are always varied, if any answers are given at all. It used to be a triple threat: tall, dark, and attractive. This is, however, out of date.\r\nThe times have changed, and women\'s expectations of their guy in a serious relationship have shifted as well. Every woman is unique, and there is no one-size-fits-all list of qualities that all women desire in a partner for a long-term relationship. However, there are several characteristics that appear to be shared by most women, and if you possess them, you will boost your own stock and appeal to today\'s ladies.\r\nI will recommend the book below if you want to know the 50 things everywoman wants from her man and I hope you apply this tips to your relationship.\r\n50 THINGS EVERY WOMAN WANT FROM HER MAN: A Guide On How To Understand Your Woman Better (https://a.co/d/66OIyLm)', 'I‚Äôm starting to think men and women have no idea what each other want.', ""That's so on point.
