0,RrPr01GhQhE,2024-05-23T16:00:33Z,How to Find Love Without Being Perfectly Happy,"I'm not a big believer in the idea that you need to be happy first before you find a relationship.

It's not that the sentiment is a bad one, but telling someone who's facing challenges in life that they now also have to achieve this elusive feeling of happiness before they can be with someone seems highly unproductive to me.

I'm here to tell you that you don’t need to be perfectly happy before you find a relationship . . .

You just need to be ""happy enough.""

I love this concept, and I think it’s something that can serve us in any area of our lives.

P.S. If this speaks to you and you want to spend 6 days with me creating the conditions for your own happiness, my In-Person Retreat is coming up this September 9-15 in Florida. Just head to MHRetreat.com to learn more.","['Matthew Hussey', 'Matt Hussey', 'Get The Guy', 'How to Get the Guy', 'Dating Advice for Women', 'attract men', 'keep your man', 'dating coach', 'relationship coach', 'relationship tips', 'what men want', 'make him like you', 'make him love you', 'how to talk to men', 'how to attract men', 'meet men', 'get the guy', 'tips for women', 'flirting tips', 'texting', 'calling', 'love advice', 'relationships', 'matt hussey', 'matthew hussy', 'mathew hussey', 'how to flirt']",PT1M,hd,false,20175,2162,25

Most people want to avoid players in dating . . . yet why do so many end up in relationships (or situationships) with them? 

Sadly, it’s all too common to get seduced into a roller coaster romance where we feel amazing chemistry but never know where we stand with someone.

Today I’m giving you the best advice I’ve given on this topic through 7 clips that will help you avoid players and find the right person. If you’re ready to rewire your brain and start attracting someone who says “yes” to a relationship, this is for you.

Sure the world might see us as strong and resilient, but in an attempt to keep up appearances, we mask our authentic experience of life, which only disconnects us further from it. 

True growth can't begin until we have the courage to accept where we are, right now—acknowledging our truths, facing our fears, and embracing our vulnerabilities. 

Getting people to this place of radical acceptance is the starting point of my Retreat program. Over 6 immersive days, we create a safe environment to confront those truths, shed the weight of pretense, and heal.

So if 2024 is the year you want to confront life's complexities head-on, with courage and self-compassion, this is your invitation. Come join me.

6,l_Cjd2ya5R0,2024-05-11T15:00:42Z,Attracted to the Wrong People?,"Why is it that we're drawn to people who treat us poorly? It's a complex issue with countless reasons. Yet there's one reason in particular that goes to the core of why so many people struggle with this, and it's ""familiarity.""

The truth is, there's something strangely familiar about these individuals and their behavior. It might be traced back to our childhood, how our caregivers treated us, or even the experiences that have silently shaped our perception of love.

If this resonates with you, please give yourself some compassion, because it's not your fault. Many of us developed these responses when survival instincts, not conscious choices, dictated our actions.

Thank you, @lewishowes for having me on your show! You can see the full podcast on his channel.

Over the past week, so many of you have expressed how much Angela’s story in my new book, Love Life, touched you deeply (in the chapter titled “Have Hard Conversations”). So this week I thought I’d share the actual interview with her from my Live Retreat.

I’ve found that one of the biggest confidence-killers in dating happens when we dwell on the reasons why someone may not be attracted to us. Our looks, our age, our past, even the fact that we have kids—the fear of rejection for who we are can stop us before we get started.
 
Angela’s story is one of the most impactful I’ve heard on confidence and insecurity, and I think you’ll love hearing it in her own words.

But don’t underestimate your ability to liberate yourself from these chronic patterns . . . you have more control than you realize.

The first step to reclaiming your peace is to consciously identify the root cause of that pain. Ask yourself: “What is the one big domino I could shift that would make the most difference to my well-being?”

You may feel SO ready to share your life with someone . . . only to have had dates that fizzled out or incompatible relationships . . . or perhaps you’ve remained single with no such person on the horizon. It can even begin to feel like that’s the way it will always be.

I’ve been asked this question several times a week for the last 10+ years. You may feel SO ready to share your life with someone . . . only to have had dates that fizzled out or incompatible relationships . . . or perhaps you’ve remained single with no such person on the horizon. It can even begin to feel like that’s the way it will always be.
 
If you’re working through feelings of longing, loneliness, or sadness—or just want to feel more excited about dating—in today’s new video, I share 3 tools that will help you effectively manage those difficult emotions, and give you real hope for the future.

A bad date—where we know we won’t see the person again—can be frustrating since it wastes our time. But what’s even MORE frustrating? An amazing date with someone who just disappears after seeing us only once or twice.
 
It leaves us wondering: “What happened?? I thought we had real chemistry!” 

In today’s video, I explain exactly why someone pulls away after a first date… 

(and how you can tell the difference between someone who’s a keeper vs. someone who’s just telling you what you want to hear.)

And the more we do it, the more we reaffirm the belief that we are not someone who deserves to be treated with respect. 

If you're in a place where you feel ready to end this cycle and start showing up for yourself, I want you to know you don't have to go through this process alone. There's still time to join me and an amazing new peer group from September 9 - 15 on my upcoming In-Person Retreat in Florida.

Long-distance relationships are a tough gig. 

You miss each other. You feel like a separate part of their life at times. And you don’t always know when you’ll be together again. So . . . is it worth it? Well, it depends.

Long-distance relationships are tough, but there are warning signs that can help tell you if it’s likely to work long-term. In fact, there’s one thing someone can SAY to you that basically guarantees a long-distance relationship won’t last, and I share it in this video.

40,XGnrnh4gjXs,2024-03-30T17:00:31Z,"What ""I Love You"" Actually Means","When we are seeing someone in the early stages, a common question we ask ourselves is: ""Do they like me?"" We think: ""If they like me, things will develop and evolve into a relationship, right?""

I'd like to challenge this instinct today. I believe ""Do they like me?"" is not the right question to be asking ourselves . . . it can even be a dangerous source of comfort that blinds us to someone's lack of intention. That's because someone liking us does not immediately translate into a real investment or a desire to progress the relationship to the next stage. 

Real progress must be measured in a different way.

41,nNiHg4mWYUA,2024-03-29T17:00:38Z,The Unexpected Truth About Commitment...,"Here’s the thing: “Playing it cool” and holding back from saying what we want can leave us falling harder and harder for someone who has no intention of investing in a committed relationship.

While there’s nothing wrong with initially seeing how things go, by continuing to play it cool, we may inadvertently trap ourselves in a state of limbo. By failing to ask questions (which can help us take stock of where things are headed), our avoidance can actually attract and enable avoiders.

I know this stuff can be really hard to get right, because there’s a delicate push and pull in every dynamic. You don’t want to always be the one putting a foot forward, because the right relationship will be an equal exchange of energy.

So how do we safeguard ourselves from this? By truly knowing what we want in love: reciprocity! And NOT getting caught up in chasing approval from someone who doesn’t want us back.

When you’re truly connected to what matters to you, you can keep moving forward and not get stuck on the wrong people.

Have you fallen for someone who just can’t give you the same affection back?

Emotionally unavailable people are the relationship version of junk food. You know it’s bad . . . but your addiction keeps you going back for more. 

This is nothing more than a formula for heartbreak. In today’s new video, I dive into the psychology behind why we’re attracted to emotionally unavailable people, and why just because something’s scarce (such as someone’s attention) doesn’t mean it’s valuable.

Do you know why heartbreak hits us as hard as it does? In today’s video, I found the answer in an interview with the world-leading expert on grief, David Kessler. 

It turns out, a lot of us are carrying around “unattended grief” that affects us in ways we don’t even realize. We often don’t give ourselves the space to fully feel what we need to in order to break free.

This new video is an important one. Even I wasn’t prepared for what I’d feel during the conversation, so I hope you’ll join me and watch it (and let me know your thoughts afterward!)

It’s normal to want to put our best selves forward on a first date . . . but sometimes this makes us hide who we really are. And that’s a shame, because someone may not see the real version of us—the one they’d want to see again and again. 

So how do you create authentic attraction early on? What are the things you could do that would make someone excited for a second date with you? In today’s new video, I share 3 natural ways to get and keep someone’s interest on a first date and beyond.

I look forward to reading your comments!

74,Vyc4ZEwHZvU,2024-01-25T18:20:10Z,THIS is What We Need to Avoid in Dating,"One of the reasons we lose ourselves in early dating, invest too much, and become too obsessed, is because we've stopped seeing someone as a person, and started seeing them as an angel. Watch this clip through, and tell me if you've ever been guilty of this in the comments.

Making someone too important early is one of the ways we sabotage ourselves when we are looking for commitment. If a loving, committed relationship with someone you can build with is something you want, there are some key realizations that will change the game for you.

I put them all in a 90 minute free event I did this week. Over 30k people have now watched the event, and the feedback has been incredible. The replay is coming down this week, so don't miss your last chance to see it. Either click the link in my bio or go to LoveLifeReplay.com to watch.

I told people at the beginning of this event: ""My goal is for you to get to the end of this event and be SHOCKED that it was free"". We literally had hundreds of messages from people afterwards telling us exactly that, and we're still getting them. Go see for yourself while it's still there!

And let me know what you think!

Yesterday I held a 90 minute FREE event for anyone looking for a committed, lasting relationship in today’s world. I believe the most beautiful thing anyone can have in their love lives is someone to BUILD with—someone who looks at you and says: “We’re in this together . . . it’s you and me.” Do you want that for yourself? Are you tired of a world that seems filled with casual hookups and people who never never seem to be ‘ready’. Well you’re not alone. Over 6000 people watched live yesterday, and thousands more are watching the replay right now as I write this.

You can still watch the replay on YouTube by hitting the link in my bio, or going to LoveLifeReplay.com.

You may not know this, but you probably have an unconscious dating mindset.

We all do. It might be learned from our parents, an early relationship, or any other kind of formative childhood experience, but it affects so much of our behavior when we meet someone we like.

In today’s new video, I’m going to share 3 of the most dangerous dating mindsets to avoid, and one powerful mindset that will let you enjoy the process while naturally attracting the person you really want.

They take you on a romantic trip, buy you an amazing gift, or tell you they’re falling for you . . . right before breaking up with you? What were they thinking?!

If you’re dealing with loss, sickness, or loneliness, this time of year can serve to magnify whatever you’re going through. 

So in this weekend’s new video, I wanted to do something a little different . . .

While this message is for anyone who needs a boost during the holidays, it’s especially for those in the middle of a “complicated Christmas.”

And today I want you to know that you’re not alone. 

Listen to this message and please do drop me a comment after you watch. I’d love for us all to feel more connected and help people know that others understand what they’re going through right now.

Lately in dating, it can feel like everything is a red flag, making it incredibly hard to figure out if someone is just having an intense reaction, or is truly not right for you. This is why I always suggest following the rule of ""invest, then test."" 

Invest a little bit, and see how they react. If being honest and vulnerable with your feelings makes things worse, that's a red flag. If they react, but ultimately have the goal of working through the issues together to make things better, then you can proceed with caution.

Here’s a common problem I hear,

You feel ready for a relationship. You’ve worked hard to improve yourself and you have high standards for the person you want to be with long-term . . . but no one you date meets your standards. 

I know it can be so frustrating—but this feeling can lead to some dangerous mindsets that get in our way of finding love . . . often without us even realizing it. 

So in today’s video, I’ll show you 3 powerful mindset shifts that will help you attract the right person faster so you can avoid self-sabotage and burnout as you search for the love you’re looking for.

Excited for you to see this one. Leave me a comment and tell me what you thought!

How do you know if someone’s really over their ex?

Sometimes you meet a person who ticks all your boxes, but they also haven’t 100% gotten over the heartbreak of their last relationship. Of course, the first questions you ask yourself are: “Is this a huge red flag? Does it mean they are emotionally unavailable? Should I walk away?”

This is a really important topic in today’s video, and my answer to this probably isn’t what you’d expect. 

Give it a watch to find out the signs you can look out for to discern whether someone is truly a bad bet or if they have real potential.

What’s the best way to go from casual to committed when you’re dating someone?

There are two important things to remember here:

• Our standards are a HUGE influence on someone’s decision to commit.
• We’re more likely to drop our standards when we really like someone.

So how do you show your standards in a confident way (without seeming demanding or needy)?

In today’s video, I share the best advice I’ve given on this topic through the years to raise your value in their eyes and build lasting attraction. Don’t miss it!

“How can I stop addictive thoughts about someone who’s wrong for me?”


When we really like someone but know there are signs of problems, we’ll often overvalue them for their charisma and charm . . . and set ourselves up for massive future heartbreak. 

If you find yourself getting fixated on someone too quickly—trying to make them fit into a relationship based on who they could be—then watch this week’s video (taken from my Live Retreat) to figure out when someone is truly worthy of your investment.

It’s easy to ignore red flags when we’re falling for someone. But our heart pays the price. 

When you’re really attracted to someone, you can talk yourself out of acting on your concerns. You may pursue someone who doesn’t want a relationship in the hope of changing them, or prioritize someone else’s needs over your own because of your feelings of admiration. 

For today’s video, I’ve gathered some of my best advice over the years on spotting and acting on red flags . . . so you can move on faster and avoid the pain of heartbreak with someone who just isn’t ready.

This is the biggest news I’ve revealed in a LONG time, and I’m beyond excited to share it with you. 

It’s about something I’ve been tirelessly working on in the background for the last 4 years . . .

In many ways, it’s been the most difficult and personal project of my life.

I’ve had to keep it to myself for what feels like forever now, but I can finally share it with you, and I do exactly that in this video.

P.S. This one is a really big deal to me. And I think it’s going to be for you too. I’d love it if you left me a comment letting me know your thoughts once you watch the video. I’ll be replying to a bunch personally today.

I’ve found that one of the biggest confidence-killers in dating happens when we dwell on the reasons why someone may not be attracted to us. Whether we’re sensitive about our looks, our age, or even the fact that we have kids, the fear of rejection can sometimes stop us before we get started.
 
Angela’s story in this week’s video is one of the most impactful I’ve heard on this subject. I’m so excited for you to see it. If you want to feel more confident in dating (and in life!) you can’t miss this video!

What’s the secret formula for flirting? 

It’s one thing we all know is important in getting attraction, but rarely are we shown how to actually do it.

In today’s new compilation video, I’ve gathered my best flirting advice from over the years, giving you a total of 19 flirty ideas that can help spark chemistry on your next date . . . or get you to date #1 in the first place!

Betrayal. Anger. Heartbreak. These emotions are normal in the wake of a breakup. 

But often, especially if we feel we’ve been mistreated by the person we broke up with, anger lingers long after it’s productive. We become captive to this toxic emotion, unable to move on and get over what happened, rendering closure impossible. 
 
So how can we truly heal from this type of pain? In today's new video, we'll discuss how.

Why do we ignore red flags when we see them? 

It's easy with the luxury of hindsight to beat ourselves up for not having walked away at the first sign that someone's behavior wasn't quite right . . . but usually, our willful ignorance comes from an optimism that people can change. 

So when is the right time to give someone more of a chance, and when is it appropriate to walk away?

Does your life need to be “figured out” before you find “The One”? 

This is the sort of advice married people LOVE to give: “Once you get your life together and you’re totally fulfilled and happy, the right person will come along.”

It sounds good. But is it true? 

In this video, I’ll give you the truth about what you need to do when looking for love so you can find the right person for you without needing to be perfect!

In today’s new video, I talk with author and radio host Tanya Rad, who shares what she did to get what she wanted in dating and how she found her current boyfriend in the process.

Her honesty is refreshing, and whether you’re in a relationship or not, I think you’ll learn something new about setting standards (and going easy on yourself when things don’t go as planned!) Moreover, her insights will help you weed out the people who are just looking for something casual so you can find the right person faster.

Sometimes it’s hard to tell the difference between dating anxiety and your needs not being met. 
 
If you know your insecurity can lead your thoughts down irrational pathways, how can you figure out if something you’re stressing about is a real concern? For instance, if you had the most amazing date last weekend but they haven’t texted you for a few days, should you be worried?

And most importantly of all, how do you get more investment from someone if you’re feeling this way?

Instead of feeling insecure and waiting for someone to come to you and meet your unspoken needs, watch this week’s video and break free from the self-doubt and anxiety cycle.

The question Audrey and I answer in this week’s new video is an important one, because it happens to people All. The. Time!

We’re all familiar with obvious red flags, but some red flags feel so good, they’re easy to miss . . . you know, like when someone is saying the most romantic things, wanting to spend all of their time with us, and making plans for the future . . .

In that scenario, it can be a little trickier to discern someone who’s pretending to be interested from someone who’s truly invested (though perhaps a little over-excited).

Are you one of those people who “loves the chase” in dating?

You meet someone, you find them attractive, maybe even go on a date, and you start to become MORE obsessed when they show you less attention, less affection, or when they play hot and cold.

Or worse, when someone shows you kindness and loyalty, and treats you with the kind of affection you so crave deep down, it pushes you further away from them.

What is going on here?!

In this week’s new video, I reveal the truth about why we fall so hard for people who give us crumbs of attention, and show you a simple mindset shift that will help you find a passionate and loving relationship.

Can you relate to this . . . 

You’ve been dating someone for months and see them once or twice a week. You’ve gotten into a pretty good rhythm, but at the same time, things aren’t really moving forward either. You’re wondering: “Do they like me? I feel like they do, and yet, I don’t know whether this is going anywhere . . .”
 
In this week’s brand-new video, I give you 3 specific things to look for when you want to know if someone’s serious (or headed in that direction).

Dating doesn’t feel magical and fun when nothing seems to be going our way. 

Sometimes it feels as though love and attention come easy to everybody else, meanwhile, for us, dating feels like a string of painful rejections or endless cycles of feeling used and overlooked. 

The reality is that some people simply have an easier time in dating than others. So if you are someone who doesn’t identify with getting a lot of attention or having much luck, how can you combat the insidious feeling of panic that it simply won’t happen for you?

If you relate to this, today’s new video will provide a much-needed boost. It will help you overcome the pain of frequent rejection and reframe the situation you’re in so you can feel hopeful again.

Sex can either be a massive turning point for a new relationship, or a gateway to more anxiety and pressure . . . 

This is because even though we may want to, it can feel hard to ask for more from the person we’re sleeping with when we’re afraid we’ll scare them away.
 
But what if I told you there’s a high-value way to approach this situation—one that can pave the way for a more meaningful connection? Don’t miss this week’s brand-new video to learn the three ways you can approach these conversations.

When is the appropriate time to ask where a relationship is going? 

If you’ve been seeing someone for a month and are sleeping together . . . can you ask then? Should you wait four months to make sure you don’t come on too strong? Or maybe you should wait for THEM to ask you? And if they don’t bring it up . . . is that a bad sign?

The truth is, we often don’t feel like we can ask because we’re afraid of the answer. 

In today’s video, I share three perspectives that can shift your mindset when it comes to discussing the future of your relationship, so you can finally break free from fear and build a relationship guided by open communication and shared values.

We’ve been told from a very young age to “play it cool” . . .

But as we grow up, we realize that when we feel we need to “play it cool” to keep someone interested, that often means we’re feeling anything but cool . . . and it usually comes from a place of insecurity or a fear of being rejected. 

Pretty soon, we find ourselves calibrating our conversations and contorting ourselves to meet the other person’s needs so we don’t come off as needy or a nuisance, and little by little, we start to show them that our needs can be ignored with no repercussions . . .
 
In today’s new video, you’ll learn the best way to increase attraction and investment in a way that doesn’t diminish your value or make you feel like a nuisance simply for stating your needs.

Have you ever deeply fallen for someone only to feel them gradually fading away? 

It feels awful. 

You panic. You overthink every text message. You worry that losing this person could mean losing your chance at a real connection, or your dream of a relationship with someone truly special.

I’ve found there are 3 common mistakes people make when they get into this panic mindset, and in today’s new video, I’ll show you the best strategy to give yourself the maximum chance of salvaging the relationship (or help you move on to find the RIGHT person for you).

We’ve all been told that we should never come on too strong, and that playing it cool is the best way to get someone interested. But how much interest is the right amount to show in the early days of dating? If we show too much interest, we worry we’ll lose all our “power,” but if we show too little, they may not even realize we’re interested. 

In today’s brand-new video, I share 5 tips on how to approach this in the early stages of dating so you can not only show the right amount of interest, but also encourage the same in the other person.

Have you ever stayed with someone in spite of them saying they weren’t interested in something serious? 

Perhaps you’d hoped that with enough time, they’d see your value, realize what you have together is special, and decide to get into a relationship in spite of their fears . . .

We’ve all heard of situations where someone did just need a bit of time to change their mind about commitment, so how can we tell a dead-end situation from one that actually has potential? Don’t miss this week’s brand-new video.

When it comes to the traits we want in a partner, “emotionally unavailable” is never on the list. So why do so many of us end up dating not just one emotionally unavailable person, but a series of them? 

When someone feels slightly out of reach, our instinct is often to chase them down and make them ours . . . but this is often an unwinnable bet, where we risk losing not only our hearts, but also our time.
 
In today’s new video, I get to the heart of what goes on when we keep finding ourselves getting stuck on emotionally unavailable people, and how we can break the pattern and find someone who’s ready for a relationship.

Have you ever dated someone who’s so hard to stay away from EVEN THOUGH they’re not interested in a relationship and you know you should keep your distance? It’s like a drug . . . or the worst kind of junk food . . . even after you swear it off for good, your resolve crumbles the moment they reach out.

When you’re in this vulnerable position, the hope that they may change and that things could be different is what drags you back in. And before you know it, you go right back to feeling powerless—holding on to someone who’s not giving you what you need. So how can you break this cycle once and for all?

Have you fallen for a guy who says he’s “confused”? He really likes you and spends time with you, but isn’t sure if he’s ready for a real commitment yet? If you’ve experienced this, you will know that this type of hedging can leave you INCREDIBLY confused. You feel you have something special with him, yet he’s still holding back. You know you can’t live in limbo forever, but you also can’t let go.


When you’re in this situation and you really like someone, their excuse can almost become a romantic challenge as you try to figure out how you can still be together in spite of any obstacles. In today’s video, I show you how to navigate this confusing situation and take back control of the situation.

In the aftermath of a toxic or narcissistic relationship, we can lose all sense of self. Whether our partner tried to steal our joy at every opportunity, or they wore down our self-esteem with endless arguments and cold-shoulder treatments . . . the end of a relationship like this will leave us feeling disoriented and lost, and it can be hard to rewire our brains and resume normal life once we’re free.
 
At this point, it can be unbelievably hard to trust other people again. Logically, we may understand that not everyone’s like our ex . . . but emotionally, we see danger at every turn.
 
But there is a way we can heal—so we can move on and learn to trust ourselves again. And in today’s video, I share 3 mindsets that can help you do just that.

We all know we won’t connect with everyone we meet . . . but one of the most frustrating situations we can find ourselves in is one where we feel an initial spark and a connection, but things just don’t seem to progress. And in the end, they end up fading as we feel a lack of momentum.

Rather than giving in to our desire to double down on communication, there’s a simple shift we can make on a date that allows unique attraction to grow. And it’s the kind of thing that will leave them thinking of us long after the date has ended . . .

If you’d like to learn what this ingredient is and how you can add it to your next date, don’t miss this week’s brand-new video.

When we like someone, it’s tempting to move fast, let our emotions take over and simply do what feels good. But in this frenzy of excitement we can inadvertently end up on a path we don’t want to be on…

In this week’s new video I answer a question from someone who didn’t want to repeat the last 2 years of her life, which she spent in a ‘friends with benefits’ situation.

Listening to our gut when something’s off can save us a lot of time and stress when we’re dating . . . but what if we can’t tell the difference between when our gut is warning us and when our anxiety is trying to sabotage us? What if the red flags we think we’re seeing are actually our fears in disguise?
 
If you have a tendency toward anxiety, this second-guessing can make the early days of dating extra stressful, because you may have a hard time separating an important concern from your ever-vigilant anxiety.
 
If you’ve ever wondered, “Is it me or is it them?” you can’t miss today’s video, in which I share five ways to tell if it’s a major concern or your anxiety talking.

In today’s new video, I share very specific principles that will be useful the next time you feel like you’re getting carried away with someone you like. And remember, no one (including yourself!) should make you feel like you’re “not enough.” No matter who you’re dating, by investing in yourself, you can come into any situation feeling like an equal.

179,GVJmS4nSPBM,2023-02-07T18:50:28Z,Kindness Is Undervalued,"Kindness is undervalued, yet it's one of the most important traits in dating. We must be sure to pick a partner who will put the needs of the relationship ahead of their insecurities and demons. And in return, we must do the same. 

True toxicity is when someone consciously (or subconsciously) puts their needs and wants ahead of what is right for the relationship itself. 

Have you ever dated someone like this? Tell me about it in the comments.

Have you ever felt like a magnet for avoidants or wondered if commitment-phobic people are all that’s left in the dating pool?
 
It’s as if you can’t even get anything off the ground, because consistent communication is never in the cards with the people you’re dating. And when you’re dating someone where everything’s falling into place EXCEPT for the fact that they’re avoidant, it can be tempting to rationalize any reason to stay.
 
But why do we do this, and why does this situation make us want to hold on so tightly to a person who’s not giving us what we need?

Today’s new video will help you reconnect with your value so you can approach these kinds of situations with a clear head and a sense of worthiness. After all, the faster you say “no” to the wrong person, the sooner you can say “yes” to the right one.

Have you experienced a situation where in spite of having dated someone for a short time, it took you weeks (sometimes even months) to start to feel like you’re over them? 

And have you found it’s EXACTLY at that moment—the moment you decide to move on with your life—that they suddenly pop back up like clockwork? Even though you know better, they somehow draw you back in with the hope that this time, things will be different. 
 
This week’s new video will allow you to finally rid yourself of the hold this person has over you, so you can begin to sculpt your life the way you want it. And don’t miss the “value exercise” I share at the end. I know you’ll get a lot out of it!

Do you find yourself watching from the sidelines as other people you know go after and get the very things you most desire?

Whether it’s love, an amazing job, or a high-value social circle of genuine, supportive friends . . . perhaps you feel envy watching other people work a room better than you—feeling like you can’t tell interesting stories, you’re not charismatic, or you aren’t someone strangers feel drawn to.

Most people don’t realize that this phenomenon is not down to personality—it’s impact, which is a skill that can be learned. Whether it’s knowing how to tell a good story at a work event or standing out on a date, learning how to make an impact is one of the most important investments you can make in your life . . . because it can change nearly every aspect of it. If this speaks to you, then don’t miss today’s new video, a mini masterclass on how to have true impact in every area of your life!

Have you ever been a victim of the most painful kind of ghosting . . . where you’re haunted by the fact that you never got closure with someone?
 
It’s the sort of thing that can consume your thoughts as you obsessively look over the final exchange you had with the person and enlist your friends to help you dissect it, hoping they can spot a clue you might have missed.

The reality is that this need for clarity and closure is a bid for control in a situation where you have none. Not only that, but every time you allow your thoughts to head in that direction, it’s another scratch at a wound that wants so badly to heal.
 
In today’s brand-new video, I give you the tools you need to move on for good from this kind of ghosting, including a text message you can send . . . not to get closure from them but to give yourself the closure you need.

Happy New Year, Friend!

Lately, I’ve been thinking a lot about the New Year’s resolutions people make, and I’m curious how you’re feeling about yours today . . .
 
After indulging during the holidays, we often place our hopes in the hands of our future selves, determined that this will be the year everything changes. Of course, having goals is a good thing, but the biggest challenge with New Year’s resolutions is how quickly they can buckle under the weight of our expectations.
 
But it doesn’t need to be that complicated.
 
Whether you’re stressed about the fact that the “you” who woke up today feels just like the “you” who woke up yesterday . . . or you just want to ensure your love life goals actually happen this year, this brand-new video is going to help you get into the right mindset for 2023. You’ve got this!

Merry Christmas and happy holidays, friend. I know the holidays aren’t the easiest time for people, and no matter what today looks like for you, I wanted to share this video. It’s a beautiful conversation I had with my good friend Humble the Poet, where we talk about how to love yourself, set boundaries, and build healthier habits around love and attraction.
 
In this new video, we go deep. It touches upon some incredibly important truths relating to how to get back in touch with ourselves (and what makes us happy), so we can make better choices in a partner.
 
I found his words incredibly heartwarming and uplifting, and I hope you’ll feel the same way. 

Happy holidays, everybody,
Matthew x

When you’re looking for a partner to have a family with, the pressure of the timeline imposed on you by your biological clock can make the whole process overwhelming. (Not to mention, when you’re fearful that time is running out, you can end up making bad dating choices.) 
 
So much information gets thrown around on the subject of fertility, and that can leave you with more questions than you had to begin with . . . 
 
Today’s new video is the most important conversation I’ve ever been a part of on this topic. I’m joined by Dr. Serena H. Chen, a fertility doctor, and Dr. Ioana Baiu, a surgeon who’s gone through the egg-freezing process, as we dive deep into the benefits and challenges of family planning.

If you’re struggling to figure out why you’re still single, in this week’s video, I give you 5 honest reasons why, plus some quick changes you can make to attract the right relationship faster.

In the early days of dating, figuring out if someone is actually open to a relationship is key.
 
But what does it mean when you ask them whether they’re interested in a committed relationship and they respond, “I could be open to that . . . with the right person”? 

This sentence can make us feel safe to dive in, but do we really know whether they’re truly looking for a relationship . . . or just telling us what we want to hear?

In today’s video, I give you three things to look for in those early days to limit the guesswork and know if things are actually progressing toward real commitment.

I post new love life advice for you every weekend.

Have you ever created an entire relationship in your head before going on a date with someone? Perhaps you’ve been texting with them for weeks and have already deduced they could be “The One,” or maybe you live for the two minutes of conversation you have with them before spin class.

Unfortunately, living in our heads in this way can turn into obsessing, and render us incapable of feeling excited about anything other than seeing or hearing from that person. In other words, they occupy a space in our minds they’ve not yet earned!

In this week’s new video, I share with you the mindsets that can both help and hurt you in dating, as well as the best way to determine if you and this person could really work out. Tell me what you think in the comments.

It’s Halloween time, and for the occasion, in today’s video I talk about what might be the most insidious form of ghosting. 

If someone ghosts you after a couple of tepid dates (which doesn’t feel good, don’t get me wrong) you can usually assume they just weren’t feeling the chemistry . . .
 
But what does it mean when someone pulls away after saying they want to be exclusive, or after texting constantly and telling you they want to see you all the time? 

In this brand-new video, I give you three reasons why someone might do this, what you should do when it happens, and the strange reason why they may choose to ghost but leave the door open. You can’t miss this topic!

Do you feel like your brain is wired wrong because despite your better judgment, you’re only attracted to the bad boys or the players?

You know . . . you love the idea of a great, stable guy who treats you right, but somehow you’ve become so accustomed to the highs and lows of roller-coaster relationships that you can’t imagine feeling chemistry with such a man.

At this point, you may be asking yourself if it’s possible to feel a spark with someone who isn’t always playing games with you . . . 

In this week’s video, I’ll give you 3 ways to create real attraction with the right kind of guy . . . because glorifying unavailable people is a recipe for heartbreak, so instead, we can start learning to enjoy healthy attention and find a loving partner.

Wondering why the guy you’re seeing doesn’t seem to respect you? You might be surprised by the reason . . .
 
If your tendency is toward anxiety, you’ll go to great lengths just to restore the peace and get things “back to normal” as quickly as possible.

This often includes the compulsion to say “sorry” even when something’s not your fault.

The danger with this is that when we make it clear to someone that we’ll do anything to avoid difficult conversations, it becomes easy for them to take us for granted . . . 
 
If any of this sounds familiar, you will not want to miss the 3 tips I share in today’s video. Not only will you learn how to honor your own needs and boundaries, but you’ll also raise your value in the process. What’s more, you’ll do so by actually living your life rather than simply existing in a state of perpetual people pleasing and anxiety.

Does absence really make the heart grow fonder . . . especially when the person you’re into seems to forget you exist when you’re not in the same room?

When you’re together, life couldn’t be better. You have off-the-charts chemistry, they’re totally focused on you, and your connection feels genuine.
 
The catch?
 
When you’re apart, you feel invisible as communication slows to a crawl and often drops off completely.
 
As a result of these mixed signals, you’re essentially living in two completely different realities, and you’d do anything to get some clarity. You might even ask yourself: “Should I try to invest in this relationship even more to show how serious I am? Or would it be better to mirror their behavior and go cold?” 

In today’s video, I walk you through what you must absolutely NOT DO in this hot and cold scenario . . . plus I give you two very specific text messages that can (finally!) get you out of this frustrating situation.

Have you dated someone you find so amazing and impressive that you almost start to feel not good enough for them? 

Maybe it’s their attractiveness or intelligence . . . or perhaps it’s their success, wealth, or status (such as the example in today’s video) that has you feeling lucky whenever they turn their attention to you.

Whatever it might be, the reaction we often have to this feeling is highly toxic for our happiness . . . because we start to shrink our needs.

We become pleasers and find it almost impossible to set any kind of boundaries for fear that this will drive them away and they’ll disappear. After all, if they left, “Would I ever find anyone as amazing as them ever again?”

Sound familiar? Then you’re going to like today’s brand-new video.

I’ve carefully designed these 7 steps to address the stages you’ll go through—in the exact order they’re likely to arrive. And while we all know this process can take an enormous amount of time to put into action, I hope these steps will serve as a compass that will keep you pointed toward your strength (in spite of any distractions the narcissist may try to throw your way).
 
I also hope this video provides you with strength, acceptance, peace, and progress as you finally move on with your life and remember what it feels like to be free from the coercive control of the narcissist in your life.

P.S. Even if you’re not in this situation, learning these principles in advance may save you a lot of time and grief down the road. And if you are going through this right now? Please know you’re not alone. I’m right here with you.

Dating is tough. The person we’re meeting up with may have been on multiple other dates this month. How can we stand out when there seems to be so much competition? 

The #1 way to separate ourselves is through great conversation. And yet most of us spend all of our time trying to look hot without ever thinking about what we’re going to say when we get there.

I’m sure you already have the “looking great” part taken care of. But in today’s video, I cover the “what to say” part—specifically, how to stand out by asking one of 8 tried-and-tested questions I’ve put together for you.

Who pays on a first date?

Six years ago, I made a controversial video tackling this very subject, and it went viral. 

Millions of people watched and reposted it (wikiHow even used it as the definitive video answer to the question) . . . It was so popular that it went viral AGAIN earlier this year when someone posted it under the title “Man Humbles a Room Full of Women.”

So this week, I decided to make a reaction video to my own video.

Does it sometimes feel like men are afraid of commitment?

You could be dating someone for a few months—and have a ton of chemistry and a great emotional connection—and yet, like clockwork, you hit a wall the moment the relationship gets to a stage where it feels like it should be progressing to the next level. Just when you start to feel that this could be something real, he puts his guard up and isn’t ready to commit.
 
Situations like these can be unbelievably painful, and they can leave you feeling crazy as you analyze the situation to death, wondering if you’re somehow not good enough. 
 
Well, in this brand-new video, I’ll share with you 3 of the main reasons why a lot of men are afraid of commitment and what you can do to turn things around by circumventing those fears.

I’ve heard this story a thousand times before . . .
 
A woman goes on a date with a guy and they hit it off. Things seem to be going well, and pretty soon, they’re seeing each other all the time. He’s texting her daily, making plans with her for the future, and every time his name pops up on her phone, she feels a surge of happiness and excitement.
 
That very same excitement keeps hitting new peaks until, suddenly, she feels a shift. He grows more and more distant, and at first she’s not sure whether she’s imagining it or whether he really is pulling away. She doubles down on effort and communication, but it only seems to drive him further away until eventually he calls it a day and stops messaging altogether.
 
If this has ever happened to you, then you know it can drive you crazy working out how to act when someone is clearly pulling away from you. 
 
But as it turns out, there is a right way and a wrong way to proceed when this happens, and it can determine whether someone stays or goes.
 
In today’s video, I’ll share with you the #1 reason why people pull away and a high-value way to respond to it.

On dating apps, first impressions matter.

And after you clear the first hurdle of endless swiping and find someone who piques your interest, it’s often the next step that’s the hardest . . .

That is, of course: What on EARTH do you say to them?!

You scan their bio, hoping inspiration will strike and you’ll manage to figure out the perfect opening gambit. You think:
 
Would a simple “hey” or “great photo” show a lack of imagination?
 
I’d like to just be myself, but it can feel so hard to be authentic without seeming too eager . . .
 
Many times, thoughts like these make us overthink everything to the point where we end up sending something awkward . . . or worse, not sending anything at all, letting the opportunity of connection pass us by. 

So how can we make an impression on people who haven’t yet had the chance to meet us and see how awesome we are? 

In today’s video, I’m going to share with you 3 openers you can send right away to stand out on a dating app.

In today’s new video, I’ll share with you exactly how to do that through 13 highly practical tips to get him to take you more seriously. Some of these are subtle, but each one of these points can have an outsized impact on how your relationship moves forward.
 
I really wanted to make this video because the tone you set in the beginning will serve you throughout your entire relationship, and the influence you can have on being taken seriously by someone is huge. It can determine whether your relationship will be a casual one that’s on their terms, or a committed, loving one where you’re building something together.

And in addition to being practical, this video breaks down the psychology behind each of these tips and provides you with examples (and in many cases, specific texts) you can customize and make your own.

Watch The Replay of my FREE Dating With Results Webinar
Only Until Thursday, July 21st at MIDNIGHT
►►https://LoveLifeReplay.com

I have had thousands of people asking me over the years how they can
find someone who is ready for commitment and serious about a long-term
relationship. Few people ever stop to ask themselves: “Do my choices
of people indicate that I am serious about a long-term relationship?”.

When I see people chasing after the wrong things, it’s clear to me
that are going to keep walking head first into the same pain they’ve
experienced over and over again in their love lives unless they change
the thing they are seeing as attractive in the first place. These are
hard lessons to learn. And they create new pain and scars every time.

If you are ready to take a deeper look at the internal mechanisms that
are shaping your choices right now and hurting your chances of finding
a healthy and happy relationship, watch Dating With Results, my brand
new FREE 2 hour training from earlier this week before it disappears.

The replay is only available for a LIMITED TIME. We are SHUTTING IT
DOWN THIS THURSDAY AT MIDNIGHT. Please, watch it now, while it’s still
there.

Over 10,000 people have already showed up to have their love lives
changed by this free training this week. Now it’s your turn…

Have you ever been with a guy you were certain would never settle down? The type who would declare to all his friends that he just “wasn’t made” for a relationship . . . only to one day announce he’s in a serious relationship or even getting married?
 
When this happens, we think, “What did the woman he committed to do that I didn’t?!”

What makes a man suddenly decide to commit?
 
In this week’s video, I not only dive into the answer to this question, but I also give you 4 practical pieces of psychology you can use to influence someone’s desire to commit to you.

P.S. I can’t overstate how excited I am about the new gift at the end of this video. I’ve been working on it for a while now and it will show you how you can define the relationship when you don’t know where you stand. I’m asked about this situation all the time, and this is the best practical tool I could come up with to help anyone in that situation.

I recently received this comment from one of my Love Life Club members, and I’m curious if you can relate:
 
“I’m starting to feel really uncomfortable with the fact that I’m still single. I can’t help but wonder what’s wrong with me that I haven’t found something lasting yet . . .”
 
This mindset is dangerous. 

Why? Because our anxiety about being single can lead us to make some really poor and damaging choices.
 
It can turn our dating life into a game of musical chairs, where we scramble to find ANY “chair” for fear of being the only one left standing when the music stops.

And as if the uncertainty wasn’t bad enough, it’s usually joined by its friends: shame and comparison. 

We often spend so much time dealing with these feelings that we forget to even make space for the behaviors that would actually move us closer to what we want.
 
That’s why we need a shortcut, and today’s video is just that. 

I share with you 7 mindsets that will take the anxiety out of being single. If applied, each of them has the potential to make a dramatic difference in your love life.

When it comes to dating, does the fear of rejection stop you from being yourself?

Whether it’s approaching someone at a coffee shop, reaching out first on an app, or allowing yourself to “let go” whilst on a date, this fear is the very thing that will have you looking back wistfully and saying “What if?” years from now rather than saying “Why not?” in the moment.
 
Of course, in a world where people are constantly trying to curate and filter their lives, it’s no wonder most of us find it scary to try something where validation isn’t guaranteed.
 
And while it might not be possible to feel completely immune to the fear of rejection, there are things you can do to move beyond that paralyzing anxiety.
 
In today’s video, I’m going to give you three secrets to changing your relationship with rejection . . .

This week’s video will help you cut through all of the anxiety, uncertainty, and stress.
 
I go deep on three very specific questions you can ask yourself to determine whether staying or leaving is the right decision for you.
 
I also break down a new model that will help you identify what to watch out for and the dangerous cocktail of certain traits we must avoid in someone . . . these are the traits that can make a relationship so toxic that over time, it will erode our confidence and identity to the point that leaving the relationship is the only option.

Understanding this model may just save your self-respect, sanity, and happiness. And once you know how it works, red flags will be much easier to spot.
 
This is a video you’ll also want to return to anytime you’re stuck in that fog of fear and confusion and want to feel a sense of clarity . . . so you can stop second-guessing your choices and move on with confidence.
 
P.S. I’d love to hear your comments on this video. What’s a “dark pairing” you’ve experienced that made life really difficult?

The content in this video incorporates some of the top questions I’ve been asked on this subject—the ones that cause people to reach out to me in SOS mode—including:
 
• When to have sex with someone you’re dating.
• How to have the conversation about sex before you sleep together (and as a bonus, I even provide a sample script you can adapt).
• How to handle rejection and ghosting.

I promise you won’t have to worry about “losing your power” ever again, because you’ll be OK no matter the outcome.
 
Your coach,
 
Matthew x

“Where can I meet quality men?”
 
I’ve probably been asked this question every day for the last 15 years.

Between endless swiping on apps and being in the same friendship circles, many people struggle to even meet people they feel attracted to. 

But is there actually an untapped magical place teeming with single guys? Should you go to a Tough Mudder to find your (slightly-dirt-stained) person?
 
In today’s video, I get to the bottom of these questions and reveal how you can dramatically increase your chances of meeting someone amazing without having to venture too far out of your comfort zone.

So this wasn’t the video we’d planned to release this week . . . 

But an online conversation turned into something so unexpected that we scrapped the original plan and recorded something new, because I couldn’t wait to talk about it.

The video this week is all about bravery and kindness, and my goal is that by the end of it, you will understand and be able to relate to men a little better.
 
Your coach,
 
Matthew x
 
P.S. Which revelation surprised you the most? I look forward to reading your thoughts as we continue this discussion . . . which has already become one of my favorites.

When you’re dating in 2022, you can almost be sure that the person in front of you on that first date is dating multiple people at the same time. This omnipresent truth can make you nervous as you so desperately want to stand out from the crowd. 

The truth is, we all want so badly to be unforgettable on a date . . . but actually making that happen can feel tricky.
 
In the pursuit of “making someone like us,” we may give in to the knee-jerk reaction of trying to impress them, or worse . . . people please. 

Even though we told ourselves we’d be chill and genuine, we suddenly find ourselves working our most spectacular moments into conversation, hoping they’ll see us for the treasure we are.

Or we get so nervous that our walls go up and we lose all warmth and become sarcastic and cutting instead.

These performances will often have us showcasing the more insecure sides of ourselves, taking the focus away from the purpose of being on that date in the first place: connection. 
 
But luckily, truly connecting—and making yourself memorable—is much simpler than that.

When a relationship with someone we had strong feelings for (or even loved) ends, we tend to get overwhelmed with emotions.
 
Whether we were with them for a short period of time or in a long, committed relationship, these feelings are universal. 
 
They can come in the form of raw heartbreak, the feeling that we’ve lost control over our happiness, a paralyzing fear that they might move on, an overwhelming desperation to get them back, or simply the pain of missing someone who used to be a constant in our life.
 
The trouble is, when heartbreak, control, fear, desperation, or pain are at the wheel, the desire to make ourselves feel better becomes insatiable and this will in turn start to dictate how we conduct ourselves.
 
The solution? Setting yourself a goal.
 
Perhaps you’ve heard of the “No Contact Rule” but don’t know exactly what it entails, or maybe it sounds a little too counterintuitive for how you feel right now, especially if you’re holding out hope that you could still get back together . . .
 
Well, I’m here to tell you that’s not the case, and in this week’s video, I distill the best I’ve learned about breakups and the No Contact Rule into everything you need to know on the topic, including what you can say at different stages.

Few things can match the heady exhilaration of dating someone and building momentum through regular texting and a sense of closeness.

But what about when the texting on their end is . . . kind of slow and intermittent . . . where there are big gaps in your text exchanges that leave you feeling unsure as to where, exactly, you stand with that person?

Feeling this way might even lead you to start analyzing their relationship with their phone the next time you’re with them, looking for clues as to whether their sporadic phone usage is consistent in their life or reserved just for you. 

At some point, they might’ve even shared a generic line with you like, “I’m so rubbish with my phone,” or “I’m really bad at replying to people!” But is this really true? 

In this week’s video, I not only answer these questions, but I dig into a really common mistake people make in this area.

What does it mean when someone you dated—a guy you still like even though things fizzled out—is still engaging with your social media?

Maybe you went on a few dates, had a connection, and even got physical, but it didn’t quite go anywhere.

Yet, strangely, he still seems to be keeping a watchful eye on what you get up to on social media.

Immediately, the gears of your mind start turning as you analyze the timing and the meaning of each emoji he sends in response to the photo of your night out with your friends.

In this week’s brand-new video, I dive into the psychology behind his actions to reveal exactly what it means when someone likes your social posts (but doesn’t reach out in any other way) . . .

. . . and most importantly, what you should do about it.

In this video, I share with you 3 mistakes we can fall into that have the potential to hurt desire.

These 3 insights could mean the difference between piquing someone’s interest and a situation just fizzling out.
 
Once you’re aware of them, they’re extremely easy to spot . . . so you won’t inadvertently end up “8-Miling” yourself. (Trust me, it’ll make sense when you see the video.)

I’ve heard this story so many times before . . .
 
You go on a date with a guy and instantly, you feel a strong connection. What was supposed to just be drinks turns into dinner, which turns into a 12-hour affair. When you do eventually part ways, you look down at your phone and find a message sitting in your inbox saying, “Can I see you tomorrow?” 
 
You feel amazing.

Over the next few weeks, it’s a whirlwind. He wants to spend every waking minute together, he’s outspoken about his feelings for you, and upon waking, you always have a “Good morning, gorgeous!” text waiting for you. 

He may even go so far as to introduce you to his friends and family . . . or say those three little words that so many others have struggled to say to you in the past . . .

It’s intense and fast, but it feels so good that you just let the romance sweep you off your feet.
 
Overnight, your life has turned into one of those romantic movie montages that show the highlight reel of a perfect relationship, except instead of the montage spanning a year or two, it’s hitting those milestones after a few weeks.

And then, of course, it happens . . . something feels wrong, the communication slows down, he starts to pull away, and before you know it, he vanishes completely.
 
You’re left dazed, shellshocked, and wounded—fully relating to the term “love bombing” and wondering if any of it was even real.
 
If this sounds familiar, then this video is for you as I share 3 tests that will help you spot a love bomber.

We’ve all done it. We start to like someone and suddenly we’ve built a whole narrative around what our future could look like with them. They feel like a rare antidote we’ve stumbled across that will take us out of being single and into the relationship we so badly want. 

The issue is, in the process of doing this, we rob ourselves of the ability to enjoy the experience—too stuck in our heads to be in the moment. 

We also run the risk of self-sabotaging as we try to see danger where there isn’t any.
 
In this brand-new video, I share an easy and grounding phrase you can use RIGHT NOW to calm yourself down if you find yourself in this situation.

Let’s be real for a moment . . . 

We all sometimes wish we could be happier.

We blame all sorts of variables for holding us back from achieving this. We tell ourselves that once we finally find a partner, secure a better job, or lose weight, life will be good and we will finally be happy.
 
But even when we achieve some of those goals, the “happiness goalposts” appear to move a little further down the field.
 
We can even forget that we have certain things in our lives now that 10 years ago we would’ve said were THE things that needed to happen in order for us to be happy. 
 
In this brand-new video taken from last week’s Virtual Retreat, I share two words that changed my outlook on this completely. They become my compass whenever life throws something difficult my way.

With this simple shift, you can give yourself permission to start your life from where you are right now . . .

You can set your watch to it. They break up with you . . . you spend weeks—in fact, months—hurting and getting over them, and just as you realize you no longer think about them all the time and begin to feel happy again, you get the text.
 
“Hey, how you doing?”
 
Does this sound familiar? I suspect it does . . .
 
So what is this phenomenon? Why do they always come back? What does it mean? And more importantly, what do you SAY when they do?
 
In today’s new video, I talk about 5 possible reasons why they come back.

For years, when I’d sign copies of my book, Get the Guy, my inscription would include the words: “Never settle.”
 
This came from a good place. I wanted—and still want—to help people reject bad behavior and find a secure, loving relationship.
 
But as I’ve gotten older and hopefully a little wiser . . . I’ve come to find new meaning in the word “settling.”
 
You see, these days we’re inundated with an overwhelming amount of choice in nearly every area, and this overstimulation prevents us from even recognizing the most worthwhile things that may enter our lives as we fall deeper into perpetual dissatisfaction. 
 
In our dating lives, this means most of us disqualify any person who doesn’t meet all of our “requirements,” as it just feels easier to place our hope in whatever we believe could be waiting around the corner.
 
But as you’ll learn in this video, “settling” in life is in fact important for our happiness—a concept beautifully explained by Oliver Burkeman in his book Four Thousand Weeks.
 
Rather than settling for someone, we should be settling on someone.

When people ask you the dreaded question “Why are you still single?” do you respond with any of the following?

“There are no good men out there.”

“Every guy I like doesn’t like me. Only the ones I don’t like seem to be interested in me.”

“I’m just too picky!”
 
If you relate to these, I suspect you’ll find this week’s video of interest. This week, you’ll learn how to find just that as I show you how to:
 
• Think of yourself as someone with agency rather than someone who’s just picky.

• Stop waiting for meaning to come to you and instead create meaning in your life.

• Become more open and accepting of yourself, which makes it easier to accept others.

How has this week’s video shifted the way you look at dating? I’ll be reading the comments, so I’d love to know your thoughts!

P.S. The relationship you have with yourself shapes everything in your life—for better or worse. If you want to learn how to build your self-acceptance and self-love muscles, that’s part of the deep work I’ll do with you on my live Virtual Retreat, happening this month from March 18-20.

In this week's video I’ll share 7 things you can do to get off dating apps once and for all, and meet someone YOU choose in real life, by inspiring them to make the first move . . . 

These include how to:
 
• Get into a very specific mindset that can instantly boost your confidence (and I’m guessing you won’t have heard of this before).

• Prioritize saying something rather than worrying about what to say.

• An easy way you can get someone to approach you, even if you’re with a bunch of friends.
 
It’s my hope that this week’s video will help you feel both prepared and excited to get out there again. You’ve got this!
 
Your coach,
 
Matthew x

These days, when it comes to commitment, it can feel impossible to know what men are thinking.

Labels sometimes take longer to come than the feelings themselves, and our fear of getting hurt can make us all reluctant to be vulnerable and express what we feel. 

As a result, so many women come to me asking . . .

“Are we living in a time when men just don’t want to commit anymore?”

“How do you know if a guy is ready?”
 
These two questions pop up A LOT, and that got me thinking about my own thoughts on the subject . . .
 
In this brand-new video, I give you 11 specific signs to look for to determine if a guy is serious about you

How much control do we actually have over our love lives? 

Some people seem to only be single for five minutes before magically finding a committed and available partner, while some of us spend years kissing frogs, getting ghosted, and wondering why we’re so unlucky in love.
 
Sound familiar? Well, maybe that’s the issue. When it comes to finding love, most people overlook the significant role that “story” plays . . . specifically, the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves in love.

You may think you know where I’m headed with this, but I think I might surprise you . . . In fact, the #1 way to break a pattern doesn’t lie in confidence or even beliefs . . . and it’s so easy to do, you’ll want to try it on your next date.

P.S. What are some of the stories you’ve told yourself in the past? I’d love to hear your thoughts in the comments.

When it comes to finding someone you want to be with, what are the specific criteria you’re looking for in a partner? 

Is it essential that they love to exercise? Do they need to believe in a certain religion? Is it a deal-breaker if they don’t share your passion for French wine?
 
Today’s new video kicks off with the news that one of the sharks from Shark Tank recently invested in a dating app designed exclusively to match people who love cats with other fellow cat lovers.

While finding like-minded people may not be a terrible idea when it comes to dating, it did spark an interesting conversation between my brother Stephen and me . . . 

This video has everything: cat people, Frodo, a Roy Kent(ish) impression, and a debate over our own criteria for relationships and whether not being a book lover is an appropriate deal-breaker. 
 
Our discussion may just change the way you look at dating in general, and I can’t wait for you to watch it.

Most of us know all too well that our healthy skepticism over whether someone is right for us is the FIRST thing we’re willing to throw out the window in the name of chemistry and a connection.   
 
In today’s video, my brother Stephen and I provide you with four questions you can ask to determine if someone is a good fit for you . . . 
 
This video is all about helping you look out for “future you” while not silencing the “you” of today.

My Attraction CPR Masterclass is just around the corner. If the person you're dating has pulled away or gone cold and you want to know why (and learn how to get their interest back), join me on January 26, when I'll be holding a two-hour deep dive on this subject for my Love.Life members. If you're not a member yet, go to AskMH.com for more information and to claim your 14-day free trial so you can join us for the Masterclass (and more) this month.  

Why do some people move quickly, shower you with love, and then become emotionally unavailable and lose interest? It can feel confusing. 

They chase and chase and chase, and then you feel like a light switch flicked and all their passion disappears. Are they misguided romantics? Or deceitful manipulators? 

If you've been through this hot and cold scenario and want to know EXACTLY what behavior to look for in the early stages, this video is for you.

Casual sex. Many talk about it and even claim to be doing it, but does it actually exist? 

Or . . . is it a trap? 
 
When I talk to people in this kind of situation, it often only takes a minute or two before fairly quickly, the mask slips and more complexity is revealed behind the scenes. 
 
Why? Well, often while one person in this situation is feeling casual, the other is feeling hopeful. 

If you want to be able to discern casual dating from dating with intention, and would like to get out of old patterns that can have you falling into a casual trap with someone you like, then this week’s video is a must-watch . . .

Historically, there has always been a lot of nasty language about ""nice guys."" The modern-day phenomenon of this comes in the version of ""simps""—men who show intense feelings of affection and love for someone without reciprocation. Often they do this publicly on platforms such as Instagram or TikTok, directing their unrequited admiration towards strangers they have never met.

Here we talk about the complexity of the phenomenon behind ""simping"" and what it really takes to get attraction beyond just being a ""nice person.""

When we meet someone we feel excited about, “love bombing” can feel like everything we’ve ever wanted. Someone we’re attracted to showering us with intensity and attention who is also happy to introduce us to their close friends and family . . . let’s be honest, it feels really good.
 
Life suddenly transforms into our very own romantic movie. Sure, the pace of it might feel a little rushed and intense . . . but isn’t that what happens when you meet “the One”?
 
But then, like clockwork, it happens. The texts stop coming in fast like they used to and we feel them pulling away until eventually, as quickly as they came, they’re gone. 

The harsh contrast between the avalanche of attention they gave us in the beginning and the cold one-line texts we’re now receiving can leave us in a state of withdrawal, wondering whether any of it was even real. 
 
This might sound familiar to you . . . it’s certainly a story I’ve heard over and over. But why do people do this? 

Be sure to watch right through to the end and write down the three keys I share with you that will help you navigate early dating traps. These will help you automatically sift out the love bombers so you can just focus on enjoying the process of dating people who share a healthy mindset and an open mind to finding a real relationship.

According to a new UK-based study, “A third of people actually find their partner to be the most annoying person they know due to their infuriating habits.” 
 
So wait . . . while we’re providing love and support to our partners, they’re secretly walking around all day upset that we left some crumbs on the kitchen counter or asked them a question while they were watching TV?
 
And if our partner is the person we’re supposed to be our truest self around, then where does that leave us?
 
We can all agree that a long-lasting, healthy connection is a beautiful and fulfilling experience. But as we depart from the dopamine-filled honeymoon phase of the relationship and into the next phase, is it possible to maintain passion and mystery?

In this video, I dive into how you can use familiarity as a foundation on which to build passion and love. (And how together, you can work on habits that might frustrate the other person without the conversation itself eroding the relationship.)
 
And remember, in the end, small shifts can lead to you becoming irreplaceable in your partner’s eyes. And in this video, I’ll show you how to make that happen.

P.S. If you’re looking to level up your love life (and your love for life) in 2022, I hope you’ll join me for some live coaching in our exclusive Love.Life membership. To sign up today and receive your 14-day free trial, simply go to AskMH.com, where you can ask any question you like.

It's no secret that attributes aren't given out equally in this world; we're all born with different advantages and struggles. But what happens when we feel we're just not ""attractive enough""? 
 
Although it's important to remember that the things we take for granted in ourselves are the same qualities others wish they possessed, sometimes we still feel affected and insecure about our looks. 
 
But we have more control over our looks than we think. Our physical appearance is greatly affected by the way we take care of ourselves: health, diet, grooming, style, and well, just trying, significantly impact our looks. 
 
So does smiling, playful and authentic self-expression, and belief in our value—all of which amount to something we might superficially term “charm.” And charm is just as real as symmetry.
 
Then of course, there's the fact that deeper attraction (creating a connection that transcends animal instincts) is what keeps someone investing in us long term. Deeper attraction is forged in the values we portray that make us the kind of person someone wants to be around in life. 
 
Finding love isn't a game of attracting everyone; it's about being irreplaceable to one person. What attracts ""everyone"" is different from the subjective appeal of YOU.

We all know the feeling. We start speaking to or dating someone and we begin to get excited about them . . . but then as soon as we show interest, they start to pull away.
 
This can be painful and demoralizing. But why does this happen? Is it them, or is it us?
 
In this week’s video, my brother @Stephenhhussey and I break down a number of “them” and “us” scenarios. For instance:
 
• Some people loathe themselves so much that they devalue anyone who starts to see value in them.
 
• Others might have an obsession with attainment, and once they “get” you, they just move on to their next quest.
 
Thankfully, in these examples, you want to scare off a person like that.
 
But sometimes our actions may inadvertently scare them off. For example: when they see us valuing them more than we should, especially given the stage of the relationship we’re currently in.

Narcissists walk among us . . . but what makes us stay with such people? 

In the beginning, sadly, many people fail to see the long-term damage a relationship with a narcissist (or narcissistically inclined person) can cause. From confidence to superficial charm or even intensity, it's easy to mistake narcissistic traits as positive ones in the beginning of a relationship. But after quickly sucking you in, they gaslight you, make you forget yourself, and cause you to start justifying all kinds of toxic behavior. All in the name of control disguised as love. 

If you've been in a relationship that has made you question your sanity, this is for you . . .

The term “narcissist” gets thrown around a lot nowadays. It’s an easy way to villainize someone we dated who didn’t seem to put in as much effort as we did . . . or a person who, deep down, we know we allowed to get away with being a little self-centered because we liked them so much.
 
But this casual use can minimize the dangers of dating a true narcissist—someone who at best will never meet our needs and at worst has the potential to dismantle our ego and our confidence because they’re viewed as a threat to the narcissist’s control.
 
If you’ve ever wondered if you’re dating a narcissist, this week’s video should give you clarity. In it, my brother Stephen and I give you 11 specific signs to watch out for (and some might surprise you!)

This is a meaty podcast and we go deep, so even if this doesn’t apply to your life today, having these signs in the back of your mind will likely save you from future grief.

You can't eat. The world seems dark. Your every thought is tinged with a feeling of loss and hopelessness.

But there are STILL choices. 

And the ones you make now will decide whether you stay feeling broken and defeated, or whether you heal and come back feeling stronger, more confident, and ready to love again.

Here's how to get on the right path back to YOU . . .

Having a reliable and steady partner may not get as much attention as other “sexier” attributes, but it really is a beautiful thing.
 
Knowing you can depend on someone romantically, physically, and emotionally can draw you even closer together—strengthening your growing bond.

And before you even enter into a new relationship, what should you look for to figure out if your attachment styles are compatible?

Did you know that men and women respond differently to breakups? My brother Stephen and I talked about recent research that showed differences in how men and women process emotional pain, how long they take to recover from heartbreak, and how likely they are to want to get back together. 

Of course, we are all individuals, and our response will also be determined by our own personality and experiences, but it's always interesting to see these general patterns of male and female behaviour and whether they conform with our stereotypes.

What do you think? Have you noticed any of these differences in your own relationships?

In this week’s brand-new video, I invite you to play a game with my brother Stephen and me as we dive into a topic everyone’s asking about: red flags and amber lights (or “yellow lights” depending on where you live).

While I’m guessing you’ve heard of the dangers of red flags, amber lights can be misunderstood. In fact, they can do one of two things: they can either reveal a major compatibility flaw between you and the person you’re dating, OR if appropriately handled and resolved, they can bring you closer together and even be the making of your relationship.

This is not the case with red flags, however, and when you ignore them, you do so at your peril.

P.S. Be sure to stay until the end, where I give you information on how you can attend my upcoming Masterclass, which will be laser-focused on “How to Spot Red Flags in Early Dating.”

I’m sure you’ve heard over and over that “confidence is one of the most attractive qualities in dating.” But when you think of that word, what actually comes to mind? Is it someone who’s bold and outspoken? A person who never cares what anyone else thinks?
 
In my experience, many people’s definitions are skewed to the point that confidence never feels achievable.
 
In today’s new video—a conversation with the amazing violinist, songwriter, and dancer Lindsey Stirling—we get to the meat of that question and define what confidence means to us.

Love doesn't change. But dating does! Over the last decade, dating apps exploded, making it possible to meet people with the swipe of a finger.

Now the next stage could be about to begin. With all the excitement about the Metaverse, will the future of dating be lived in the virtual world? Facebook, Tinder, and other big tech companies are all looking to get on board. Will you?

What’s your biggest regret in life?
 
Is it a mistake you continue to dwell on? A path you realize you should’ve taken? A person you wish you hadn’t given so much time to?
 
And if you had the opportunity, would you go back in time and do something differently? Or would you take this Cormac McCarthy quote to heart: “You never know what worse luck your bad luck has saved you from”?
 
Regret is more than a sad, wistful daydream. It can cause us a tremendous amount of pain today and actually prevent us from enjoying our lives.
 
If you’re holding on to any kind of regret, you can’t miss this week’s new video.

Couples who meet online have a higher divorce rate?
 
According to an article Jameson shared with me, a recent study found a 12% divorce rate within the first three years of marriage among couples who met online, compared with a 2% divorce rate in those who met through friends.

The takeaways from today’s new video will provide the tools you need to boost your odds of staying together, no matter how you got together. (We also answer some less serious questions like why my mum didn’t want to meet my girlfriends for a while, and whether or not Stephen could live on a farm.)
 
I’d love it if you left me a comment after you check it out.
 
Your coach,

Matthew x

As I read through the comments on last week’s video, “6 Relationship Red Flags That Are Surprisingly Toxic,” it became clear that people were hungry for more details about the right way to be vulnerable with a partner or someone they’re dating.
 
Have you ever had an insecurity, a jealousy, or something that hurt you or made you feel threatened, but you didn’t know the right way to bring it up?
 
Of course you have. We all have. Maybe you’re feeling that right now. It can be terrifying, can’t it? 

Well, here’s the good news . . . being vulnerable can actually create a deeper bond with someone, as well as reveal if they’re the right person for you in the first place.
 
The bad news is that if we’re not careful, constructive vulnerability can mutate into what I call “dumping.”

This video will reveal what you can do if you’re worried you’ve fallen into this trap, or are about to . . .

What are your biggest red flags when it comes to dating? Have you thought about them?

In this recent conversation I had with Dr. Tracy and Dr. Morgan, you’ll learn how to easily identify these 6 critical red flags. We start off with No. 1 . . .

 No.1 🚩THEY CAN’T APOLOGIZE 🚩 

(I can feel your anger rising already with this one) Ever been there? I have. And, well, yuck. If you’ve been there, you know that someone who is incapable of apologizing slowly turns us into a crazy person who begins to lose their grip on reality. 

I talk all about this, and 5 more we should all be aware of, in my new video.

I haven’t been this excited to show you something brand new in a while.
 
We collaborated with an incredible director friend of ours, Ryan Turner, to craft one of the most epic and cinematic videos we’ve ever made . . . (Think Game of Thrones . . . you know, if Arya Stark was suiting up for a date and not a bloody campaign of vengeance.)
 
Thanks for all the ways you support me and our work here. Thanks for laughing with us, crying with us, and being our champions when we do something downright silly.

Back in ye olden times, the fear that a partner might be cheating was enough to keep someone up at night. But in recent years, we’ve added a new layer of anxiety to the mix: “micro-cheating,” a.k.a. “back burner relationships.”
 
In fact, when Psychology Today recently polled people who are in a relationship, 56% revealed they had a back burner person: someone they’re in contact with who could be an option if their current relationship doesn’t go the distance.
 
That’s not to say that everyone realizes what they’re doing. Many feel it’s harmless—that they’re just being friendly and keeping in touch with a friend.

Today’s video will give you a simple test to figure out if you’re in a back burner relationship, and provide you with the mindset you need to give your current one its best shot.

It would be nice if we had a crystal ball telling us which romantic flings would work out at the very beginning so we didn’t invest precious time in the wrong people.
 
It can be hard to read someone’s intentions in the early stages.

I can’t make you a foolproof lie detector, and I can’t guarantee you’ll never be ghosted again, but I can make you a competent “detector of intentions” so you have the best possible chance of investing your time into people who are serious about a relationship with you.

I was recently watching Jordan and Mikhaila Peterson chatting with Russell Brand, and I heard Jordan say something that caught my attention. He said, “I don’t think it’s possible to grow up without having children.”
 
It’s an interesting statement. And I know it’s the sort of statement that produces an instant emotional reaction in people. It will create one reaction in people who have children, another in people who have chosen not to, another in people who want them but haven’t had them yet, and another still in those who desperately wanted them and never had them.

In this new video, we tackle questions like:
 
• Is someone else really “further ahead” in life if they’re in a relationship, are married, or have kids?
• How should you feel if you’ve chosen (or ended up on) a different path?
• Is there a mindset that can help when friends or family members pressure you or make you feel deficient?
 
I’d love it if you left me a comment with your thoughts. I’m here for the discussion, friends.

How much time have you spent beating yourself up for things you wish you’d done differently? Whether it’s due to:
 
• A relationship you should’ve left months (or years) earlier
• A family member you could’ve created more distance with
• A job you stayed in too long
 
. . . it’s easy to mentally pummel yourself as you think about all the time you wasted.

Not a day goes by that someone doesn’t ask me this question in one form or another.
 
Why? Because few things in life involve more gut-wrenching second-guessing than deciding when to quit a relationship.
 
With heightened emotions and conflicting intuitions, it’s no wonder this situation gives our hearts and minds disorienting whiplash . . . all while wasting our most precious resource: time.
 
Today’s new video could end up saving you months or even years of pain by providing you with the questions you should be asking when making this big decision.

Ever found yourself slipping into the therapist role with a guy when what you really want is to create deep attraction with him?

Instead of being in a fun, flirtatious situation with someone who’s trying to get to know more about you, you find yourself sitting patiently while someone unloads all of their problems onto you.

You’re not alone. But there is a way out.

In this brand-new video, I show you how to escape the “therapist trap” with a guy so that you can keep building the attraction and tension that lead to a second date.

Matthew x

P.S. If you’d like the chance to ask me a live question—and join what is essentially a gym for your psychology, your emotions, and your confidence—consider this your personal invitation to sign up for a 14-day trial to my Love.Life Club at AskMH.com. I hope to see you there!

Last week’s video led to some of the most interesting comments I’ve ever read on our YouTube page. From “sizing up” an infamous TV show shower scene to supporting my brother Stephen’s desire to have burritos in his life, you didn’t hold back. And I loved it.

While we don’t do a lot of two-parters, we couldn’t help ourselves when it came to this topic. We decided to correct some errors in our last video and then do a deep dive into why so many people are enticed by the idea that they can “fix” another person.

Ultimately, we too often think we’re just playing with romance when we’re really playing with our time. And if nothing else, I hope today’s video helps you safeguard yours.

Get ready for a saucy video this week.

My brother Stephen and I start by talking about a now-infamous shower scene from a new Netflix series about the temptation of infidelity. If you’ve seen it, you know exactly what I’m talking about. If you haven’t seen it, then let’s just say this shower scene exposes a large “elephant in the room” when it comes to male insecurity.
 
But this video is about much more than Netflix’s “sizable” fantasies. Today, we have flawlessness at our fingertips—including endless Instagram feeds featuring six-pack abs and lithe, cellulite-free bodies. How is reality supposed to compete?

This is an oldie but it’s a line and a sentiment I still believe in. I’m not saying you should say this mindlessly to prop up a mans ego. And I’m not suggesting you say it if it’s not true. But if you relate to this feeling around your guy, it’s something that will make him feel fantastic. 

It’s a beautiful feeling for most men to know that they are having this kind of an affect on the woman in their life. It’ll also have the added bonus of making him want to look for more ways that he can make you feel safe and protected since you’ve now given him an identity he wants to hold onto and reinforce.

I’m about to share a recent public moment that bothered me . . . 
 
While watching a video clip from my recent appearance on the Pretty Intense podcast with Danica Patrick—an experience I thoroughly enjoyed—I couldn’t help but notice something: I kept saying a particular word. And not just once or twice. Over the course of just a couple minutes, I couldn’t even keep my total in the single digits (and you can see the final staggering tally for yourself in this video).
 
As someone who’s spent an entire career in public speaking and content creation, the more I said this word, the more the demons in my mind went into “media frenzy press conference mode.”

Prepare yourself: This video is an honest reenactment of how embarrassment plays out in our heads.

I hope this gives you a laugh and also helps you realize that you can take something like this and use it to turn a mortifying moment into an opportunity for growth

In this week’s video, my brother Stephen and I dig into a fascinating study in which nearly half of the people surveyed said they would call off a date if they weren’t feeling great about their body that day.
 
We’re not talking about serious body/mental issues here. Think more along the lines of a bad hair day, a prominent zit, or the extra pounds you gained from that holiday weekend.
 
Insecurities like these cause many people to preemptively reject themselves because of something the other person likely wouldn’t have noticed or cared about.

I hope this video inspires you to go a little easier on yourself, and I’d love it if you left me a comment letting me know what you think.
 
Here for you,
 
Matthew x

When I heard of Anthony Bourdain’s passing in 2018, it hit me hard. And when I recently watched the new documentary Roadrunner: A Film About Anthony Bourdain, it drove home some of the reasons why his death left so many people reeling.

It’s not always easy to talk about the messier aspects of life, but it is important. And the more we can help each other during the more challenging moments, the more we’ll be able to access the truth and beauty Bourdain aspired to.

When someone’s betrayed or hurt us—especially when we didn’t see it coming—it’s hard to avoid the lack of trust that latches on to us and shadows us into our next relationship.

Is there an antidote to this? Is it possible to regain trust after heartbreak?
 
In this week’s video, I share 8 rules you’ll want to write on sticky notes and keep handy whenever you need a reminder.

As always, I’d love it if you left me a comment letting me know your favorite rule (and your favorite Jim and Pam moment from The Office . . . I hope you enjoy the example I included this week).

The need to impress at work or on a date has become so intense that many people cling to “fake it till you make it” as their mantra.
 
And while a dose of optimism and confidence can be a good thing, this mindset can lead to emotional exhaustion and imposter syndrome

In today’s video, I give you a mindset shift that will not only banish imposter syndrome, but will change the way you approach future work projects and romantic dates.

Avoiding this one trap will make the rest of your life so much easier, and I hope you’ll leave me a comment once you give it a try.
 
Here for you,
 
Matthew x

In this week’s video, I’m asked what my “why” is—what motivates me to keep doing what I do. And my answer often comes as a surprise: to help people feel less alone.

Just because many single people feel lonely doesn’t mean the two need to go hand in hand.

I sometimes get tired of the “peak performance” rhetoric where everything is about productivity at the highest level. It devalues the importance of just feeling okay and connected and loved, especially during moments of pain or loneliness.

It’s my hope that today’s video encourages you and helps you realize that you’re not alone. If we can just make this world a little bit less lonely for each other, we can literally save lives.

Here for you,

Matthew x

P.S. Sometimes even the smallest gestures can make a huge difference. I’d love it if you left me a comment letting me know something someone did for you that made you feel less lonely or more connected

Dating fatigue is real. Given the option, I think most people would choose to bypass the process entirely and skip directly to being in a meaningful relationship.

But since science isn’t quite there yet, how can you manage your energy so the dating process—the part you need in order to FIND that relationship—doesn’t burn you out before you even GET to the good stuff?

In today’s video, I share 5 tips that will help you find an energy-replenishing relationship rather than an energy-depleting one. You’ll learn how to:
 
• Ease into getting to know someone rather than pinning all your hopes and dreams on them.
• Communicate from a place of strength rather than insecurity.
• Match your investment and energy to the stage of the relationship you’re actually in.

You’ll want to bookmark this video and rewatch it before any date.

Last week, we talked about how the right partner will “elevate your best and soothe your worst.”
 
But what if you feel like your best isn’t good enough? Or you’re afraid your worst will be “too much” for someone?
 
In this situation, it can be tempting to overcorrect—to go overboard in your efforts to impress someone until they finally discover what you’re “really like.”

In this week’s new video, I’ll teach you how to shift from looking at yourself through a lens of self-judgment, self-loathing, and self-hatred, and instead view yourself from a place of self-compassion, self-love, and self-empowerment.

There’s an ongoing debate when it comes to meeting “The One.” Which camp do you fall into?
 
1) Is it all about meeting the right person—someone amazing who will remove any lingering doubts and inspire you to get serious?
 
2) Or is it less about “The One” and more about “The Timing”—meeting a compatible person at the right time in your life?
 
This week, I get to the heart of the issue with 7 tips that may change your perspective on dating and relationships. 

P.S. I’d love it if you left me a note letting me know which tip gave you the biggest “aha” moment. I really enjoy reading your comments each week.

What will your dating life look like in the second half of 2021?
 
As worldwide restrictions started to ease, news outlets declared that the post-lockdown world would likely give birth to a “new Roaring ‘20s”—a bacchanalian frenzy the likes of which our generation has never seen.
 
While it’s true that some will embrace this openness with abandon, new studies are revealing something unexpected: many people are interested in finding a serious relationship as a result of the pandemic, because this past year has made them aware of the traits they value most in a partner.
 
This particular moment is critical, because many people are likely to “panic buy” their way into a relationship—throwing themselves into the first nice person they meet as soon as the “gates open.”
 
Thankfully, there’s a simple step you can take before a first date that will ensure you’re meeting people who are a better fit.
 
In this week’s video, you’ll learn how to find a committed partner who will be excited to redefine the “new Roaring ‘20s” with you (whether or not they can dance the Charleston).
 
Here for you,
 
Matthew x
 
P.S. Which trait is #1 on your list? I’ll be reading the comments and would love to know yours!

We’re told all our lives that confidence is the key to everything from our careers to our love lives, but few things can feel more nebulous or fleeting.
 
Even when we finally achieve the things we thought would give us confidence, it often slips just a little more out of reach. Life becomes a chase of “I’ll finally feel confident when . . .” and that “when” rarely materializes.
 
In today’s video, I’ll show you how to craft a confidence that’s unique to you: one that doesn’t rely on the achievement of some external goal, and one deeply rooted in who you ALREADY are.
 
P.S. Be sure to watch all the way to the end to discover the secret project I’ve been working on and how you can be a part of it. This one’s HUGE. I’ve never done anything like it, and it won’t cost you a thing. Please let me know in the comments once you’ve signed up!

Perhaps you’ve felt it after someone ghosted you following what you thought was a perfect date . . .
 
Or after pouring your heart and creativity into a project only to have it ripped to shreds by those you admire most . . .
 
Or getting laid off from the job you thought you’d retire from . . .  
 
Rejection can come in many forms, but the gut punch feels the same as it shatters your ego. 
 
Ultimately, the history of your rejection has been written, but the legacy of it is for you to decide

The way you craft this legacy can result in some of the most meaningful wins of your life, and in this week’s video, you’ll learn how to make that happen. (Plus I’ll also share an embarrassing story of a lesson I learned whilst recording in Beverly Hills 10 years ago . . .)

P.S. Our final Virtual Retreat of the year is coming up September 24-26. The feedback from our last Virtual Retreat has been nothing short of amazing. And this month only, we're offering an incredible $100 discount and throwing in three priceless bonuses with your ticket. Don't wait, head to https://MHVirtualRetreat.com and claim your May special offer.

It’s happened to the best of us. The flirty text banter that used to cause a surge of adrenaline has become pedestrian. And pretty soon “How was your day?” becomes “How was your week?”
 
Or perhaps they initiate a text conversation and tell you what they’re up to, but never actually ask you out.
 
Fortunately, all it takes is one small shift to turn it all around.
 
If you’ve lost momentum with someone, feel your momentum is headed in the wrong direction, or just want to improve your communication,  this week’s video is a must-watch. I give you 6 specific text messages you can use or adapt to transform your current situation. 

The great news is that you only need to try one of these 6 texts to change your dynamic right now. Be sure to let me know which one you try first in the comments!

 Have you ever found yourself dating someone, knowing that there’s a lot right with them, but still plagued by a nagging thought in the back of your mind about whether you’re going to be happy with this person long-term?

How do you deal with the doubts you have about a person? Should you continue to move to the next stage of the relationship with them? Or is it too big a risk?

Do you just ignore your feelings and keep going, or pay attention to that doubt and leave?

You don’t have to resort to either of these two drastic options.

In this video, I show you an in-between strategy that allows you to find out for sure if your relationship can work, without risking too much of your energy and precious time . . .

Often when we call it quits too soon, we’re left with that horrible feeling of wondering whether it could have worked with someone. I don’t want you to be left wondering; I want you to have answers.

(And be sure to watch to the very end, because the cameras were still rolling and caught the TRUE NATURE of my brother Stephen bullying me relentlessly . . . let me know whose side you come down on . . . as long as it’s mine.)

We’ve all experienced this relentless form of self-torture . . .
 
Whether your breakup was two days or two decades ago, you find yourself looking back and wondering how things could’ve turned out had you acted differently. Had you known then what you know today.
 
Pretty soon, you’re living in the timeline where you didn’t “ruin everything” with that person . . . ultimately punishing yourself over a parallel universe you’ve created in your mind.

This week, my brother Stephen and I answer the question, “Is it possible to ‘blow it’ with the right person?” and share how you can turn self-loathing into a better relationship with yourself (and your future partner).

Chances are, if you've been in the heady throes of romance, you've also suffered a few emotional bruises at some stage on the road to love.

But does that mean you should carry your wounds with you? And even if you're over the pain, how should you tell your next partner about it?

Join us on the LoveLife podcast to learn why it's not about what happens to you, but how you talk about what happens to you that really matters.

Sometimes we avoid speaking up about what we really want with a person because we’re afraid we will “make waves” in the relationship. 

We come from a place of fear and anxiety. “What if me telling him I want something to be different makes him walk away altogether?” we think to ourselves. 

So we ignore the conversation and silently suffer. But then nothing gets better. We just put off the conversation for another day while time keeps moving on. 

If this is you, this video is for you.

P.S. Early bird tickets for the second and final Virtual Retreat of the year (September 24-26) are only available until the end of the month. These tickets are at a deep discount and have some really special extras thrown in. Don’t miss your chance → http://www.MHVirtualRetreat.com

When we meet someone we like, it’s human nature for our imaginations to run wild. No sooner have we been on a great date than we start assessing where things could go and all of the ways this person could be the one. 

These thoughts (which are just thoughts) start leading to real excitement. And this visceral excitement converts into energy. And more thoughts. 

The energy comes in the form of investing much more in this person—thinking about them, trying to reach out to them even when we don’t get the same in return, talking to our friends about them. 

The thought part is where we start telling ourselves that this situation is “high-stakes.” “They could be the one!” we think. “We better do everything right. Don’t want to mess this one up.” 

And all of this leads to the meticulous planning and obsessing over every move we make. All of which is counterproductive to the kind of energy that, perhaps, might be right to bring to a second conversation with someone.  

Avoid this mistake, me ol’ mate! Watch the new video now.

Do you feel you’re holding yourself back in life? 

Do you avoid taking risks with people you’re attracted to? Do you find yourself shying away from new things in life, new experiences, new possibilities? 

Are there things you’ve been talking about doing in your career or life that always seem to stay on the horizon and never actually happen? 

It’s tough when life makes it hard for us to achieve things we want to achieve, but it’s far worse when we know that WE are the ones holding us back. 

It could be through fear of rejection, failure, not feeling worthy, or simply being terrified of the unknown. 

And we’ll find all sorts of logical and rational excuses for why we can’t do something now, why it’s not the right time, or why we’re not capable or ready. 

But the truth is, we can waste our entire lives holding ourselves back from the life we could have and becoming the person we want to be. And that can happen in the blink of an eye. We wake up one day and realize that all that time we thought we had is gone. 

This week’s video will save you from that fate . . .

I believe in talking about ideas that matter and can help people lead better lives. It’s hard for me to think of anything that fits that description more than the issues this video deals with.

I’ve done my best, but I know it won’t be perfect. It’s not meant to be. I just want to begin the conversation in our community. I look forward to learning more from all of you as I go. 

Women of my community, I did not create this video for you to do anything. It’s a video we men need to see. I hope you’ll help me share it with more of my brothers, because the change has to come from us.

And I’d love for you to join me in the comments to share your experiences and further educate us.

We have your back here, and we love you.

Got a brand-new video for you and I think you’re going to love it, especially if there’s someone in your life who continues to occupy your thoughts even though it didn’t work out.

There are 2 types of people from our past—distant or recent—that cause us pain in the present. And chances are, if you can’t seem to move on from someone, they fall into one of these 2 categories . . .

The good news is that this video will show you a neat trick you can do right now that will change the way you think about this person forever. And when you do it, you’ll instantly feel at peace in a way you don’t right now.

Hope you’re having a beautiful weekend, friend. As always, I’m in your corner.

I’ll keep this short. If you’re experiencing any kind of pain right now from a “situation” or a relationship ending, this brand-new video is a must-watch for you today.

It could be the pain of having been ghosted . . .

It could be the pain of someone you were seeing regularly going cold on you . . .

Or it could be the terrible heartbreak of a long-term relationship falling apart when you didn’t want it to end. 

In this video, my brother Stephen and I are not merely talking about how to get over your pain, but how to deal with it while you’re still in the middle of it—perhaps even in the worst phase, when it feels like it’ll never go away. 

I’m here for you.

P.S. This video may be the greatest gift you can give a friend or family member who is experiencing this kind of pain right now. Who could you send this to to help them get through the day?

Whether you’ve been watching my videos for 5 days or 5 years, this is one you can’t miss. It’s one of the most fundamental concepts I’ve ever taught, and it is the key to: 

- Increasing your confidence 
- Expanding your life
- Being irreplaceable to the person you want 
- Being able to handle any part of your life going wrong 

This is where my dating advice meets my deeper advice for how to live an extraordinary life. Don’t watch this video for dating tips. Watch this video to level up your entire life.

Every week, I help millions of people create the love life they’ve always wanted. But I don’t want the state of your life and your happiness to ever be dependent on the status of your love life. 

The great irony is that it’s when your happiness no longer depends on the status of your love life that your love life finally has a chance to click. 

Enjoy this video. It’s a big one.

OK, picture this . . .

I’m in my local coffee shop, minding my own business—my business in this case is ordering an oat milk flat white (just in case we ever go to coffee and you want to know what my order is)—and I get talking to a woman who tells me she’s mad at me. 

She knows who I am, she’s a fan, she even said my program worked for her, and yet she told me she was mad at me. 

In this week’s new video, I tell the full story . . .

You’re going to want to watch the full story, because it highlights how so many people get hurt because they follow 95% of my advice, but ignore one of the most crucial things I say. 

Think of it this way: you can have all the right ingredients to bake a cake, but if you forget to add baking powder, the cake isn’t going to rise. In this video, you’re going to learn what the baking powder of dating is. Without it, your relationship will not rise, which explains what happened to this woman I met in the coffee shop. 

Check it out, and don’t forget to leave me a comment when you get there. 

Happy weekend, friend! 

P.S. I’m giving away a free video module of one of my favorite programs, Attraction to Commitment, at the end of this video. If you’re sick of guys wanting to see you casually, and are ready for a real relationship with someone who’s willing to commit, this is for you. Watch till the end of the video where I give you your free training link.

Want to hear something that drives me a little crazy? 

It’s when people say: “You need to be happy first, before you find a relationship.”

In my brand spanking new video, I call BS on this idea (please be aware there is no actual spanking in the video). Come on over and I’ll tell you why all the annoying people telling you this are wrong.

P.S. We’re one month out from my next Virtual Retreat, March 19-21! This could be your last chance to make it happen. The first one back in October was a huge success, and I’ve been working with my team for months to make this one even better.

It includes 3 days of immersion coaching to work on new habits, new purpose in your life, leveling up in every area, and becoming the most confident and in control version of yourself you’ve ever been. This is NOT a love life program—it’s a complete life makeover, inside and out. If you don’t have your ticket yet, there’s still time.

Happy February! :-)

I just made this video for you. I think you’re going to love it, especially if you don’t always find it easy to be vulnerable with someone you’re dating.

Do you find it hard to truly let down your guard with a man? 

What do you do when you get angry or hurt? Do you get quiet? Passive-aggressive? Lash out?

If you know that the way you’re bringing things up isn’t productive, and has the tendency to push someone away, my new video is essential watching today...

Let me know what you think.

Quiz for you...

What do the following 3 things all have in common?:

Getting nervous on a date
Getting upset that someone isn’t texting you back
Not being able to get over a breakup

Can you guess? 

The answer is in this week’s video, let’s see if you got it right...

You’re going to witness a moment in this video that was taken from a live, exclusive webinar I held for my Love.Life members that wasn’t open to the public.

There was an exchange that happened that is going to change the way you deal with dating disappointments forever. 

If you find it hard to recover from the rejection and the sadness of someone not calling after a date, or sex, or from it simply not panning out with someone you were seeing, this is a game changer...

Sending you love, friend!

Are you a list maker? I am. It’s how I get things done. 

But doesn’t life sometimes just feel like an endless “To-Do List”? We wake up, make a list, do what we can on that list, and before we know it, there’s another day, gone. 

And, if we’re not careful, we get to the end of every day feeling like our confidence has been eroded because we didn’t even get to half of the list. 

Not to mention there are always those same things on our to-do list that never seem to get done. They just endlessly roll over to the next day, and the next one…

I don’t want my life to be one long box-ticking exercise, do you? 

If you want to feel like you’re truly LIVING, not just ticking boxes, check out my new video. 

The technique I give in this video shows us how to feel connected to the things we have to do in our day so that we don’t become list-checking zombies with no real joy in our lives.

I know once you learn this, it will become an indispensable part of your daily practice. I look forward to your feedback.

I’m guessing you don’t just follow my work for love life advice...

Unless you discovered my content yesterday, you will have realized by now that the communication skills I teach have massive practical application for your business relationships, your ability to network, your ability to persuade, to captivate, and to navigate challenging conversations in every part of life.

I’ve not just used these skills in my own love life. They have been the fundamental people skills I have used to create every opportunity I’ve ever had and get to where I am today. 

And I know that in 2021 you have goals outside of your love life that are deeply important to you. I want to help you achieve them. 

This week’s video is going to show you 7 techniques I use time and time again to make an impact on whoever I’m speaking to and create new opportunities in my life. 

There is so much content packed into this video, it shouldn’t be free. But it is. So please take the time to come focus with me for a few minutes and take some notes. I also have a value-packed surprise at the end for you (also free!). 

See you there!

Have you ever felt insecure about something that’s happened with your partner and got yourself worked up in your mind? I have. Many times. 

And when this has happened to me I know I’ve not brought up the issue in a productive way. In fact, I’ve often approached the subject in a way I later regretted. 

What about you? Have you said something you wish you hadn’t? Reacted in a way you wish you could take back?

It’s a horrible feeling when we “sober up” emotionally, the cloud of angry or upset subsides, and we are left with this sinking feeling that somehow we’ve just messed it all up. 

If you can relate to being the kind of person whose emotions and anxieties can be easily triggered in a relationship, this video is really going to help you.

My aim with this video is not to guarantee you never get anxious again (would you even believe me if I said that was possible?!). My aim is to ensure that even in those moments where your fears and anxieties become inflamed, you have a way of calming them, and approaching your partner in a way that brings you closer together, rather than hurting the relationship.

Let’s take back control over those emotions and put you back in the driver’s seat. And let’s learn to use our moments of friction to make our relationships even more beautiful.


P.S. Even if you feel you’ve already done the damage and this video came too late, you’re wrong! By watching this, you’ll be able to explain to your partner what happened in that moment and hit reset on that mistake, because once you have, they’ll understand you so much better.

Happy New Year!

I’m going to keep this short, because I think this video is going to say it all, and be an incredibly powerful start to your year. 

Do you want to be more confident this year? No, really. Not just say it, but BE it? Do you finally want to step into your life, feeling not just comfortable in your own skin, but owning it, ready to take on whatever challenges come your way? 

If so, these 7 minutes might be the most important 7 minutes you’re going to have today, because they are going to shape your mindset for the entire year. Seriously. 

In the video you’re about to see, one of our podcast listeners asked me what insecurities I struggle with, and how I maintain my confidence. This was my answer, and I genuinely believe it’s one of the most important things I’ve said in my career. 

I’m ready to make this my most beautiful year ever. You in?

Happy Holidays,

I hope you’re having a beautiful time wherever you are, and whatever (potentially modified) version of the holidays you are having right now. I’m sending you love, lots of love.

As we roll into the New Year, it seems like as good a time as any to talk about our standards. We think of a new year as being a time where we reset our standards, don’t we?

And yet, have you ever worried that you’re being too picky?

And have you ever wondered if this “pickiness” is the thing that’s stopping you from finding a relationship? 

I was on stage when a woman stood up and asked: “Matthew, should I listen to my mum and lower my standards?”

It’s a hard thing trying to figure out if the reasons you are rejecting people are valid, or if they represent an “unreasonable” standard that you need to let go of.

I hope this new video provides a little clarity...

Happy Holidays again, friend. I’m thinking of you more than ever right now.

OK let’s talk about it. 

The infuriating phenomenon of men disappearing in the early stages of dating, even at times when things appear to be going well!

It can be so hard to know what you’re supposed to do with a person:

You play hard to get, and he doesn’t even know that you’re interested...

… so you show him you’re interested, but then he loses interest because it seems too easy.

So what’s the answer? 

In this video I tell you, and I share the secret to showing your interest in such a way that he keeps coming back for more.

Oh, and if you find you’re in a continuous pattern of things fizzling out early in the dating process before they even get a real chance, stay until the end of the video for a special gift that’s going to help you with that exact issue.

If you find yourself currently in a long-distance relationship – or “situationship” – then I made this video for you, my loyal friend. 

In it, I give you the 4 questions you should ask to figure out if it’s all worth it. Because let’s face it, long-distance relationships are HARD. WORK. 

They require dedication, commitment, loyalty, and a real vision for the future. Do you ever find yourself worrying if yours has what it takes? Or wondering if the person you are giving all of this mental and emotional energy to from afar is actually serious and will pay off in the end, instead of wasting your precious time? 

You can also check out this video to see my “baby” brother Harry say some deeply hurtful things to me. Enjoy.

I post new love life advice for you every weekend.

Maybe you began this year with visions of finally creating the love life you always dreamed about. 

You told yourself: “This is the year I’m going to meet my person.” But then this year happened, and it made dating even more complicated, more exhausting, and more futile than it seemed to be already. 

And now you sit here, at the end of another year, with this feeling in the pit of your stomach. A feeling of frustration, resentment, and even panic. “I’ve lost an entire year of progress in my love life because of this pandemic.” 

In this week’s new video, I’m going to give you a blueprint for what to do to still move your love life forward, even while this marathon we’re on continues. 

Time is too precious to waste. There are so many ways to still move forward. You just need the right plan...

We in this community aren’t just survivors, we are adapters. So let’s do what we do best and make this situation work for us. In the video, I show you how. 

Love you, friend.

I wanted to step outside of the dating conversation for this week’s new video.  

Relationship or no relationship, the quality of our lives is the quality of our emotions. And many of us feel plagued by our emotions. Whether it’s depression, anxiety, sadness, shame, guilt, fear… we can find ourselves living in a constant state of suffering. 

If you can relate to this, please watch this before you do anything else today...

I’ve had moments in my life where I was scared I’d never feel better, especially if there was a certain negative emotion that I kept returning to no matter what I tried. 

It can make us feel hopeless, like we’ll never be happy no matter what we do. If you feel stuck in a place like this, please take a few minutes to hear what I have to say in this video. It’s not some magic pill, it’s a real approach that will relieve the tension you feel inside right now. 

Don’t lose hope. We’ve got this. I promise you.

I love you, friend.

I get SO many questions about standards in early-stage dating every week...

How do you set standards? 

How do you know if your standards are too high, too low, or are scaring people away? 

How do you communicate your standards in a kind and honest way? 

What if all of my standards are fulfilled by someone except one important one? 

To answer some of these questions, this week I take a real woman’s story and give 3 practical techniques for solving it that I think you’re going to find really valuable.   

If you struggle too much inside your head when you like someone, especially if it doesn’t feel like it’s quite going your way, this video is going to help you make sense of things…

Also, we are finishing this year with a bang. As you know, I just released my brand new program The Momentum Texts (thank you to all of you who got your copy, and for the incredible early feedback). Well, to add one more surprise, at the end of this new video I announce something many of you have been waiting for in the last few weeks. I’ll see you there to tell you about it.

If you’re sick of the lack of progression in early stage dating...

If you’re tired of things never actually going anywhere…

And you’re wondering what simple things you could be doing differently to change that…

This video is for you.

(It also contains a very special guest who hasn’t been seen in a long time, but is demanded on a daily basis. You’re welcome.)

Can’t wait to hear what you think.


P.S. BIG announcement at the end of this video. Make sure you watch right till the end so you don’t miss it.

I post new love life advice for you every weekend.

Have you ever wondered what the right amount of effort to put in with a guy is? 

Should you let him know you’d like to go on a date with him? And what about after the date…

Should you let him know you’d like to see him again if you felt the date went well but he’s not being proactive about setting up another one? 

Where is the line between showing a guy you like him, and chasing someone who’s simply not that interested? 

It can be tricky. But I want to make it simple. 

You may have heard me say, “Invest in those who invest in you.” But that could leave you wondering to yourself: “Fine Matthew, but so often that means I’m doing nothing because no one is investing in me! And doesn’t someone need to take the first step to invest something if anything is ever going to happen?”

It’s a valid point. I’ll show you exactly how to solve this at the end of the video, so make sure you watch it through.

Is there a spooky presence lurking around you?

Do you have a “ghost” in your love life? 

Are you the victim of a “haunting”? 

Is there a “zombie,” back from the dating-dead, knocking at your door all of a sudden? 

Are you like me and had to look up at least two of these three 2020 dating terms that have been created by twenty-something writers at magazine websites?

I made a Halloween-themed video about these – apparently new – dating phenomena. I tell you practically what you should do about each of them, and, most importantly, I simplify this whole convoluted, ridiculous mess. 

Basically, if you’ve got someone in your life who’s either treated you carelessly or simply not investing, check this video out because I’ll tell you what to do.

May my voice of reason forever haunt you in your dreams.

Are you seeing someone who won’t commit but who doesn’t let you move on either?

You’re about to hear a phone call between me and a young lady who had this issue and wanted to know what was going on in his mind.

She was adorable and funny, just like this animation we’ve put together telling her story. You also get to see me portrayed as a detective getting to the bottom of the case…

In this video, you’ll learn about the psychology of someone who won’t commit, and what you should be doing about it if you find yourself in this situation. 

Stay safe out there, my pickles.

Do you ever find yourself getting attracted to people who are unavailable (emotionally or otherwise)? Treat you poorly? Or simply aren’t interested in you? 

Why does this happen? Why do we conveniently keep getting attracted to the least convenient people? 

It can be deeply frustrating, especially when there might be someone who does like us but who we just don’t want. 

In this video, I explain two fundamental reasons why this keeps happening. 

At the end of this video, I give you a practical “mind trick” you can do on yourself to change this... 

Learn the 2 mistakes that keep you from meeting the right person...

Ever found yourself in a situation where the person you are with is doing something that affects you negatively, only they don’t see it as a big deal?

They tell you they don’t think they’re doing anything wrong, and that you should be OK with it. That’s what happened to the woman whose story I tell in this video. 

Her boyfriend was regularly texting a female friend he’d made only recently. Every time she got upset about it, he told her she was being unnecessarily controlling and jealous and that he wasn’t doing anything wrong. 

In today’s video, you’ll see exactly what I think she should do about this situation...

I always think one of the hardest things in a relationship is trying to figure out where we are overreacting and where we are justified. It can be maddening. 

If you’re wondering whether what someone is doing around you should be a deal-breaker, this video will help you figure it out once and for all. 

Always in your corner.

P.S. The first-ever Live Matthew Hussey Virtual Retreat is just around the corner. People from all over the world are signing up to join us October 16th - 18th, not just because they have always wanted to take my Retreat, but because it’s a fraction of the cost of my live Retreat (and with none of the travel and time off work!). There may never be a better time to join the Retreat than this. Go here to book an appointment with one of my team and find out more: http://www.mhvirtualretreat.com.

What do you do if the person you are with comes to you telling you he wants a break? 

You’re devastated, you’re scared, and every instinct in you tells you to fight for this person you care about so much. 

What would you say to him?

In these moments we often do exactly the opposite of what we need to. If you’re in this situation, or you ever want to know what to do if someone says this to you again, please check out my new video. It’s going to give you the only response you’ll ever need...

I’d really appreciate it if you would share this video with as many women you care about as possible. I believe that if a video like this was given to all of us at the beginning of adulthood, it would save us all years of unnecessary suffering.

Have you been gaslighted before? Is it happening to you right now? 

If you’re not sure what “Gaslighting” means… It’s when someone manipulates you by psychological means into doubting your own sanity. 

Over time, this can have a dramatic effect on our self-esteem as we slowly begin to doubt ourselves until we no longer trust our own instincts. It’s nasty.

If you want to know whether this is happening to you, as well as get a practical guide on how to deal with it, check out this week’s new video. 

If you’ve ever expressed your needs to someone or tried to tell them about something they did that hurt you and you were made to feel crazy, this video is for you. It’s a horrible feeling when we are upset or anxious and we don’t even know if what we are saying is reasonable or whether we are overreacting… that’s why I’m so excited for you to see this video. It’s going to bring you a sense of peace and calm again...

I’ve got your back, friend.

Maybe you’ve always been afraid of rejection. 

Maybe there was a specific moment in your past where you experienced a devastating rejection that has left you fearing getting hurt again ever since. 

The problem with the fear of rejection is that it still hurts even when we are not getting rejected. I was taught by my boxing trainer, Martin Snow, that the worst punch you get is the one you never actually get hit with. It’s the one you think about and fear in your mind. That means that even without literally being rejected, we experience the pain by imagining it over and over again. 

On top of that, we beat ourselves up for all the things we are missing out on as a result of our fear: potential partners, opportunities, experiences, adventures, and most importantly – our full potential.  

Fear of rejection is one of the most human things in the world. We all experience it. But how can we learn to manage it, live with it, and even occasionally, overcome it? 

Watch today’s new video to find out. 

I know you’ve had knocks. I know you’ve been dealt some really unfair situations. I know that sometimes it feels like we can’t take anymore pain. But life is short...

I’m with you, friend.

Ah yeeeeah, it’s that time, friend… a brand new spicy video for you. 

This one is about compliments, and there’s some really interesting psychology in it about the compliments you can give to a person to create deep attraction between the two of you.

One of them works for when you first message someone on an app…

The 2nd one is great for when you are meeting someone in person…

The 3rd one is for someone you already know and want to build more attraction with. 

This video is super practical. Take 4 minutes to watch it, then use one of these compliments today. If you’re not going to use one of them, you’re not allowed to watch it. OK? Don’t watch the video and then not use one of them, because I’LL KNOW.

Hope you’re having a great day, you beautiful human.

I can’t tell you how many times a week someone online says to me: “Matthew, I’ve had enough. I’m just going to give up on dating altogether.”

It may be because they are sick of getting their heart broken. It may be that they are exhausted from going on dates that don’t go anywhere, or online conversations that never even get to the point of a date in the first place.

It could be the frustration of never meeting people they have true chemistry with, or when they finally do, discovering that they aren’t looking for a relationship. 

If you feel any of these things, I made this week’s video for you.

If you feel you’re close to giving up on this area of your life, I have no righteous ground to take in telling you you’re wrong. I completely understand it. It is unbelievably frustrating, especially when you want nothing more than to just get on with sharing your life with that special person instead of more time passing without them in it.

You’re not weak or crazy for feeling the way you do, so give yourself a break. But before you give up, just do me one favor – watch this video today.

Are you hurting? 

Is that hurt leading to overthinking? Rumination? A downward spiral of negative self-talk? 

Do you feel trapped inside your own head, desperate for some relief, and anxious for the time to come when you will finally feel better?

If so, this video is required watching. To do something special for my Love.Life members, I invited the one and only Guy Winch on for a special hour to help people overcome pain and hurt. Guy Winch is one of the world’s foremost experts on dealing with heartbreak and “emotional first-aid.” 

This video is a special moment taken from that hour where Guy talks about how to deal with moments of terrible pain in a productive and healthy way. 

One of the really powerful distinctions Guy makes in this video is the difference between productive and obsessive thinking. 

As Rainer Maria Rilke said: “No feeling is final.” If you’re hurting right now, it’s going to get better. I promise. 

One step at a time.

Ahhhh. So excited for you to see this video. 

(My director, Jameson Jordan, killed it this week.) 

I talk a lot about letting go of the wrong person. But how do you know if someone is the wrong person? What are the red flags? 

How can you tell if someone is serious or just stringing you along so that you don’t waste your time? 

This video solves that problem for you. 

In this video, I add a distinction that I’ve never said before and I don’t think you will have ever thought about…

Let me know what you think once you’ve watched it, friend. 

Much love.


P.S. For all the sh*t you’re going through right now that others don’t know about, I love you and I’m with you.

You have to help me. 

I believe there isn’t a woman (person) alive who doesn’t need to see this video at least once in her lifetime. 

I know, that’s a bold statement. But when you see it, you’ll know why. 

My work is about more than dating. It’s about time. Time = Life. And this video is designed to save your precious time.

We have made a short movie that talks about what “it’s complicated” really means. If you’re in a situation with a man that gives you far less than you want or deserve, watching this video is the most important thing you could do with your time today.

And I rarely ask this, but please do more than watch this. Share it with every woman you know. I have spent over a decade working with women in their love lives. I’d go as far as to say no one has been witness to more women throwing away their precious time on the wrong situations than me. 

My No.1 objective is for this video to help you get brave enough to say “enough is enough” in your own life. My 2nd objective is for you to help me save the lives of other women – your friends, your sisters, your mum, your daughters… anyone you care about. People don’t always have the wake up call on their own. Sometimes they need our help.
 
No more wasting time. I know it’s hard, but I’m with you. I’m in your corner, always.

This week’s video is about moving in together. 

But you should watch it even if you’re not at that stage with someone, because it contains a truth that is essential to understand when moving from one stage of a relationship to the next. 

If there is someone in your life you plan on getting more serious with, this is for you.

I felt this video was especially relevant to these times where the term “turbo relationships” is on the rise. A “turbo relationship” is a relationship that is moving unnaturally quickly because of the circumstances of this year – lockdown necessities, spending large chunks of time with each other, choosing one person instead of casually dating multiple people, and moving in together far earlier than we otherwise would. 

All of this puts pressure on the relationship that can be counterproductive to it going somewhere long term. If we want to build our relationships to last, it’s important they don’t burn out before they’ve really begun.

This video will show you how to ramp up your relationship without ramping up the pressure. 

Enjoy!

Ever sat ruminating obsessively over something you could have or should have done differently in your relationship? 

Something you said, something you did, or something you wish you’d have done more? 

It’s a dreadful, sickening feeling. I know because I’ve felt it. It leads to regret, anxiety, self-loathing… not to mention a lack of appetite and insomnia. We turn over every memory, imagining where we could have been with that person had we just behaved differently. 

And this feeling isn’t limited to situations that have ended. Sometimes we are still seeing someone but we have this crippling anxiety over having irreversibly damaged the relationship. We feel we’ve created a perception of ourselves in that person’s eyes that we can’t now undo.

If for any of these reasons you are currently torturing yourself, this video will be life-saving for you today. Trust me when I say it is essential watching. 

In this video, I break down for you why you don’t need to be wallowing in pain, and why, despite everything that destructive voice inside is saying, you actually have reason to feel good today. 

Please also share this with someone you know who may be beating herself up right now. Life’s too short for any of us to suffer needlessly. 

I’m with you, friend. You’re loved.

Have you ever had someone come into your life, dazzle you with their initial investment and attention, only to disappear as fast as they came?

This phenomenon has been nicknamed “Love Bombing,” and it can be very painful, especially when you were led to believe it was going somewhere. 

You may be asking yourself why someone would do this. In this week’s video I’ll show you…

My hope is that this video will not only give you a sense of closure, but also help you to move past the heartache you are feeling right now if this has happened to you. I also show you how to avoid it in the future. 

Here for you, friend.

You’ve probably spent a lot of time in life figuring out certain things that are really important to you in a relationship. It’s something we tend to get clearer about as we get older. 

But what if when you express your need for something, the person you’re with makes you feel unreasonable, high maintenance, or even crazy? 

It’s a horrible feeling. It has the potential to erode your confidence, make you question yourself, and settle for far less than you’re worth simply to appease that person. 

It’s what leaves us feeling at the end of a relationship like we have lost ourselves in the process.

In this week’s video, I coach a woman whose partner doesn’t value physical affection like she does. You’ll hear what happens when she expresses that she’d like more touch from him...

One of the hardest things in a relationship is figuring out whether we are the one who’s being unreasonable or they are. We get so close to the problem that we no longer know what’s right and wrong. 

I believe this video will help you answer that question if these issues are a source of friction between you and the person you are with.

Oh, and I don’t say it often enough… thank you for being part of this community. I really appreciate you being one of my followers, and have huge respect for your willingness to continuously grow. I love that you’re here.

Have you ever been hurt badly by someone in love?

Those wounds can stay with us a long time. They can stop us from taking chances again in love. 

They can make us afraid of getting close to someone again…

Afraid of being vulnerable again…

Afraid of letting someone in…

Because if the result of letting our guard down and choosing to love someone is that we give up all of our power, then why bother, right? Sure, we may be giving up the special experience of being in love, but at least we don’t have to experience those dreadful lows. 

If you can relate to this, today’s video is for you. You’ll hear me doing a live demonstration with someone who is going through exactly this issue. And what I tell her may be exactly the words you need to hear right now.

This isn’t video isn’t a pep talk. It’s a rational, practical strategy for how to navigate your love life after someone has hurt you, or broken your heart or your trust (or all 3). 

And as a bonus, this entire live demo is animated for your entertainment. We’ve worked hard on it, so I hope you love it. 

Here for you, friend.

I hope you’re doing well.

I’ve been thinking about one of the biggest dangers of personal growth these last couple of weeks.
 
The danger is this: we learn a crucially important, life-changing lesson, and then forget all about it and move on with our lives. 

Any one of us could fall into that trap this year. Like me, you’ve probably had some realizations about your life during this difficult time. Epiphanies about changes you want to make, or simple truths that you want to take forward even once things return to “normal.”

But the integration of these lessons and truths into our lives going forward is no guarantee. In fact, for most people, it’s much more likely that nothing will change. 

Think of that, we were just forced into a giant reset, the likes of which we may never have again in our lifetimes. And yet, most people will go back to living the same lives they were before once the daily stresses, invites, and activities return. 

We simply cannot let this happen.

So what can we do? Well, the first step is consciously taking stock of what those lessons are, and codifying them so we don’t forget them. 

In this week’s video I reveal 6 of the unexpected lessons I’ve learned in the last 3 months...

Come see if any of mine are the same as yours. And, in the process, write down what yours are. I can’t say this enough: do not move on from this moment in time without bottling the lessons and taking them with you, or all of this pain and struggle will have been for nothing. 

I’m committed to my growth and yours. Since these last 3 months have been so tough on us, why don’t we turn the tables and make them work for us now? 


P.S. If you’ve been spending a lot of time beating yourself up recently and it’s exhausting you, lesson #6 in this video is for you. We’ve got this, friend.

“How do you avoid negative self-talk after a breakup? My ex was extremely critical and I want him out of my head.”

That is the question we answer in this week’s brand new video. I say “we,” because I’m not alone in this one. I’m joined by a very special friend of mine, Jeannie Mai – Emmy Award-winning co-host of “The Real,” and host of the podcast “Hello Hunnay.” 

Jeannie is wonderfully entertaining to listen to, and has a first rate mind on these things, as you’ll see from the video.

And, what makes this video “extra” special is that it's taken from a 90-minute interview I did just for my Love.Life members, so you’ll get a taste of what goes on behind the curtain of my private membership. 

If you are struggling with negative self-talk, this video is literally a precise prescription for what to do next. It’s 7 minutes of viewing that will make your life better today, I promise.

P.S. If you find this video as valuable as I know you will, and would like to watch the full 90-minute interview, you can access it right now with a free 14-day trial to our Love.Life Membership. Claim your trial at http://www.AskMH.com.

414,KncWAtoi4as,2020-06-06T11:45:00Z,To My Community (Matthew Hussey),"A mere 2 weeks ago it would have been hard to conceive of a world that was about to heat up considerably beyond the tension and emotion already experienced in 2020.

Then came the murder of George Floyd. Since then, I, living in Los Angeles, have watched the United States – and beyond – reach a boiling point on race issues. It’s a dark time, and yet it also feels like a time where real change could be possible.

I find myself asking of what service I can possibly be. Another weekend rolls around, my weekly video spot awaits my thoughts, and I have no clever words chambered. 

It doesn’t feel like the week for a love life video. And yet it does feel like a week where I want to be with you, my community, more than ever. I ask politely that you not confuse that with my having any answers. 

All I have is me, letting the Black members of my community know what I have always felt – that I consider you my sisters and brothers, and that I, Matthew Hussey, stand with you, always.

The fact that Black lives “mattering” is even an idea that needs support in the year 2020 is an astonishing prospect. 

But to all the Black members of this community, let the bloody obvious be stated here and now: My team and I love you, and you matter to us. 

To brighter days. 


For anyone interested I have included a list below of organizations I have chosen to support with donations this week. **In addition, when we first posted this video this morning, I had it demonetized out of respect so as not to profit from this video. However many of you pointed out in the comments that it would be better to have ads turned on and have the revenue go to the cause. I love the idea, so I have, and 100% of the proceeds from this video will also be donated to the causes below.

I hope you’re doing OK. I just wanted to let you know that Jameson and I have just finished putting the final touches on our brand new video and it’s ready for you to watch right now... 

This video is an honest look at what the near future of dating could look like for you if you’re single right now. 

Even as parts of the world open up again, a vaccine appears to be at least 8-12 months away. That means that for about another year, there will be some significant implications for our dating lives. 

Is it safe to go out on dates in the coming months? When should you meet up with someone you’ve been talking to? How do you deal with awkward moments like the first hello where you would normally hug each other? Is there an elegant way to communicate what level of contact you are comfortable with?

These are all questions I answer in this video. At the beginning of COVID-19, I made a video outlining the immediate impact of this virus on our love lives. Consider this a round 2, but this time with a focus on the future of dating. A kind of “State of Our Unions” address for 2020, if you will.

I’d love to know your thoughts in the comments, and please share with anyone who is anxious or concerned with the future of their dating life. 

There is reason for hope, my friend. 

As ever, I’m thinking of you as we go through this together.

I’ve lost count of what week of social distancing we’re in. But I do know that if you’ve been living with someone since quarantine started then you’ve had your ups and downs.  

We need space in our relationship for desire to thrive. But how do you create space with someone who is always there?

If absence makes the heart grow fonder, how do you stay exciting to your partner if you're never absent? 

We’ve just made a beautiful new video with some simple, practical ways to approach this situation and avoid making the mistakes that are hurting good relationships...

If space isn’t coming naturally in your relationship, there are ways to engineer it. And this video isn’t just about getting space, it’s about bringing back the moments of magic, and romance, and love. 

Even if you’re not living with someone right now, you can use these ideas to make sure your long-distance situation stays vibrant and alive. Your situation may be different, but the psychology is the same.

Thinking of you, friend.

Hey.

Hope you're doing well :)

I wanted to use today's video to talk about our fear of what other people think.

How often do you find yourself anxiously thinking about what others think of something you've done? Or not doing something because you're worried about how your friends, family – or even strangers – will react if you do?

I've spent the last decade of my life in the public eye in one way or another, so I've had a lot of time to worry about what others think of me. There have been days where it's bothered me so much I've not wanted to do it anymore.

And yet I've still managed to continue to make videos, appear on TV shows across the world, be interviewed on national radio, and, well, just generally be “out there.”

In all of this I've often wondered the same thing you have...

Is it actually possible to stop caring about what other people think?

My answer might surprise you, and it also contains the secret to how I've continued to do what I do, regardless of what people think.

Watch Now: My brand new video on dealing with this debilitating fear. 

Thinking of you through all of this.


P.S. Thank you for your support during this time, even in just reading these emails and watching my new videos. It brings me so much purpose to be able to connect with you during this difficult time, and continues to be one of the great joys of my life. I so appreciate you.

“WTF? Do not use this.”

This is a comment I received last week.

It was in response to a flirty little text that I suggested you use with the guy who is on your mind right now. 

In fact, this text really seemed to divide people. Someone even said it could result in “catastrophe.” And this comment had likes. A lot of them. 

W. T. F. 

So, despite the fact that I was going to move on to a different topic this week, my director Jameson Jordan politely (feistily) asked (demanded) that I respond to these comments. And I never say no to Jameson when he gets feisty. So, here is that response...  

You might be a little surprised by my response, because if you felt like the texts I suggested were a little dangerous, it might reveal a bigger, deeper, more important red flag at play.

I hope you enjoy it. And if you don’t, please don’t leave any more comments that make Jameson make me do more work. I’m tired, and I’m in my pajamas.

Hey :) 

In today’s video, I’m bringing you some practical advice on how to flirt at a distance. 

Some “Quarantexts,” if you will. Ahem. 

Think of them as little bits of irresistible charm that you can send to the guy who is on your mind right now. 

These texts are designed to bring a smile to his face (and yours), as well as kick off a playful dynamic so you can develop (or strengthen) your bond – even when you’re not physically together.

Just because we’re stuck inside it doesn’t mean we can’t flirt, whether it’s with someone we’ve been seeing for months or someone we just met. In fact, we must flirt – none of our romantic situations will survive without it. 

Thinking of you, friend.


P.S. Stay to the end of the video to get a whole list of cheeky texts you can use to keep the attraction going. #8 is my personal favorite – adorable and sexy at the same time.

Maybe you went into the quarantine with a love interest already who is now “long-distance.”

Or maybe you just met someone online during isolation. 

Either way, my guess is you want it to actually go somewhere and not fizzle out during this time while you can’t see each other.

So how do you keep the momentum going? Today’s brand spanking new video (woohoo) shows you exactly that, with something blindingly obvious that 99% of people are not using to their advantage. 

If you feel like you had a connection with someone, but now you’re worried you’re becoming invisible to him, the advice in today’s video is for you.

And if you just met, this will make you stand out from anyone else he may be talking to. Once you try this, your voice will be a burst of color in a sea of gray interactions. And to help illustrate my point, I’ve taken us back to the 1920s...

Stay strong, friend.

Another week in isolation...

This crisis is really putting a magnifying glass on my (alarmingly natural) gift for hibernation, as well as my capacity for eating chocolate. How about you?

It’s also exposing a lot of cracks in relationships – both those under the same roof and the long-distance ones – as they strain under the weight of this “new normal.” 

Just this morning, I had the pleasure of working with a woman who is in my live coaching group, and she confided that she was having an issue with her boyfriend. 

Like many, she found herself in a long-distance relationship all of a sudden, as she and her guy self-isolate about 30 minutes from each other in their separate homes.  

I said to her, “That must be tough. Are you speaking every day?”

Her answer revealed more than I anticipated...

It quickly became clear to me that her needs were being ignored, and that she was ignoring a conversation she needed to have. Something I’m worried too many people are doing right now. 

If you’re in a similar situation, where you’re feeling scared to ask for what you need, then you need to watch this video.

Thinking of you. 


P.S. If you stay until the end of the video, you’ll get free access to a training session where I coach a woman to be her bravest self. I know it will give you courage (and the tools) to do the same.


P.P.S. Always remember, your standards aren’t a luxury. They are a necessity.

Brand new video for you.

Well hello there from isolation. 

Guess what? I made a new video for you. And I’m really proud of it. And I think you’re going to love it. 

It’s about how to be a more interesting and engaging person in any interaction with someone through 5 quick principles you can instantly apply. 

And since most of us are having long-distance conversations with everyone right now, the ability to talk effectively has become utterly essential. 

These techniques will show you how to take your talking to another level.

And I know they work because I live by them. 

They are relevant whether you’re in the same room with someone, sending voice notes to a new guy, or connecting with a love interest over the phone as we all social distance. (They also apply to business, so you get two for one in today’s video.)

Can’t wait to see what you think.


P.S. If you stay to the end of the video (you better) you’ll get exclusive access to free training that breaks down exactly how I create a connection in the first 5 minutes of interacting with someone. If there’s only one thing you do this week to improve yourself, make sure it’s watching this training.

I don’t know about you, but I’m already exhausted by the avalanche of motivational quotes online right now. 

Advice everywhere. Everyone talking. It’s kind of numbing. 

Realistically, we’re not exactly focused on how to live our “best” life right now. We’re trying to keep ourselves and our families safe, salvage a few of our regular routines, and keep ourselves from devolving into a Netflix and Oreos spiral. 

Well, at least I am.

And just like you probably do, I fluctuate between being OK and feeling intense melancholy about the situation. (I’m also sick of being taunted by home workout videos I’m not actually doing.) 

Anyway. If you can relate to any of this, I made you a video. 

I certainly haven’t got this all figured out. And you probably haven’t either. But I think there are some very manageable ways we can feel a little better right now, and release the pressure of the unrealistic expectations many of us are putting on ourselves in what is already a very difficult time. I explain them in the video...

One day at a time, friends.

What a week...

It’s a time of mixed emotions. Anxiety. Stress. Fear. Uncertainty. Boredom. Resentment about losing the year we thought we were going to have in 2020. 

This crisis is impacting people all over the world to varying degrees. And with how rapidly it is evolving, I have wanted to hold off on wading in with my opinions until I really felt I had something to say.

Alongside all manner of life-related issues people are asking me about, they are, of course, eager to hear my answers to their love life questions during this time:

How can I date during this time of social distancing? 
Should I move in with my ex so that I’m not alone in this time? 
How do I keep my (now) long-distance relationship alive? 
How can I handle living with someone I’ve never spent this much time with prior to isolating with them? 
How will I get through this if I feel totally alone?

Whether you’re single and looking to meet someone special, or dating someone you can’t physically be with right now, or even if you’re in the middle of healing post-breakup… there is a silver lining I talk about in today’s special message...

Please share this video with anyone you know who needs it. 

And more than ever, I want to stress that I am here for you. We are a team. And we will get through this together. 

I love you, and I’m thinking of you.

425,-Hu0zkX3_qE,2020-03-22T11:45:01Z,Do You Feel You’re Giving Too Much in Relationships? (Matthew Hussey),"Hey everyone! So many of you have been asking me questions this week relating to the crisis: managing your emotions, knowing what to do with your love life during this time, knowing how to keep things going with someone who has become long distance due to quarantine. I’m going to use next week’s video to give my thoughts on some of these issues. This video was shot before the world changed (although the content is still vitally important) and we didn’t have time to shoot another one to replace it. But stay tuned for next week’s video! And be sure to follow my Instagram (@thematthewhussey) where I’m giving my current thoughts on the developing crisis. Thanks everyone, and stay safe. Love you guys ❤🙏

Do you ignore red flags?

Do you feel like you give too much in your relationships?

Do you brush things under the carpet when someone violates your boundaries?

If so, this week’s video is specifically for you…

The richness and depth of a true connection can only come from giving other people the chance to reciprocate your warmth, kindness, and giving nature…

Because while it might feel selfless or nurturing to pour into others without receiving in return – it can actually backfire, weaken your connection, and make you feel resentful. 

I promise that if you find the courage to be honest, you’ll find more satisfaction, fulfillment, and happiness in your relationships.

“Is there anything I can do to rekindle the relationship with my ex?”

It’s one of the biggest questions we have after a breakup. 

And if you’re finding yourself losing sleep at night, replaying conversations and events, wondering if there was anything you could have said or done to keep the relationship… then this week’s video is for you. 

It’s an example of a conversation you can have that will empower you to either rekindle your relationship with your ex… or get the closure you want so you can move on. 

Most relationships end for a good reason. But if you really feel like he is worth fighting for, then this video will give you the tools to have a productive conversation.

If only so you can sleep soundly at night, confident that you left nothing unsaid...

This language will give you the closure you need.

Whatever happens, you and I are going to move into this next chapter of our lives stronger. I won’t settle for any less from you.

Ever found yourself attracted to the wrong person? 

Or getting interested – even turned on – by the wrong sort of behavior? 

It’s more common than you think. And this pattern will continue if you don’t figure out why you keep responding to these bad behaviors. 

This week, I sit with my friend Aubrey Marcus for his podcast. He’s a fascinating guy whom I’ve loved spending time with since we met on our Ice Retreat in January. 

Mid-podcast, a really interesting moment happened...

He asked me about a questionable technique certain men use to get women attracted. Spoiler alert: it’s not a kind one. 

You’ll hear us talking about it in the video...

My response won’t surprise you.

But what concerns me deeply is that this technique exists because it often works.

I want to ensure it never works on you. Let’s make sure your confidence is never so low that you respond to this kind of thing... 

P.S. Thought for the day: Some guys are not there for you to “figure out.” Do not waste your life trying to decipher the behavior of the wrong person.

Imagine this...

I’m sitting in a bar in New York. 

It’s late. I’m drinking a margarita. 

A woman is sitting across from me. 

We’ve exchanged glances for over an hour, but neither one of us has mustered the courage to make a move. 

Suddenly she’s up and starting to leave – perhaps having decided that I’m not going to do anything. I watch with this feeling in the pit of my stomach. You know, that mixture of self-frustration, anxiety, and regret. I had missed my moment. And it was my fault.

She walked, reluctantly it seemed, towards the door. I was now blowing it in slow motion. And then, just at the last moment, her eyes meet mine one last time, she makes a gesture to me…

A gesture so simple, and yet I felt myself filled with the urge to do something...

Suddenly I was unfrozen, and walking over to this enchanting stranger. 

(Watch the video to learn what she did...)

Whether you know it or not, you have this ability too. And it can be as simple as the gesture she made to me that night...

Even if you consider yourself to be shy, or new to dating, or are on the verge of giving up because you’re burned out on the whole “swipe right” dating culture...

What I show you in this video could easily mean the difference between you meeting your future partner, or spending a lifetime complaining you never meet anybody special.

Breakups are incredibly hard. 

And a split can be even more excruciating when your partner moves on while you’re still healing. 

It can leave you with all kinds of painful questions like: 

“Why wasn’t I good enough?”

“What does that person have that I don’t have?”

“Have I lost the love of my life to someone else?”

It’s one of the worst types of pain there is. And if we don’t learn the right lessons from our breakup, it can create baggage in the form of insecurities and an unwillingness to open up to someone new. (Risking your chance to find real, lasting love.)

But closure can come faster than you expect with a simple shift in the way you choose to think about your ex, and yourself. I’m sharing this powerful shift with you today.

If there’s anything I want you to take from this video, it’s that while what you’re going through is hard, it’s also an opportunity. A chance to let go of someone who couldn’t see your value, so that you can make space for a man who can. 

If someone doesn’t choose you, they cannot be right for you. Period. There’s someone better on the other side of all this. I promise. 

Today’s video was inspired by a brave male audience member who was devastated when his girlfriend of 5 years moved on only four months after their breakup. Not only will you learn something from the response I give him, but you'll also get insight into how men process pain. Spoiler alert… we ain’t that different.

Answer me honestly…

How often do you celebrate your wins?

And how often do you agonize over your mistakes?

For most people, the answer is that they’ll spend (maybe) 30 seconds celebrating their successes… but hours, days, years, and even decades berating themselves for their slip-ups. 

(Things that other people don’t even remember because we’re all too busy worrying about our own lives.)

This adds up to a whole lot of wasted energy.

And what’s even worse than the wasted energy, is that it makes it impossible to be happy, even when things are going well. 

What could be more tragic than getting to the end of your life and realizing that you lived an entire lifetime without ever really being happy on the level you could be?

We have to change that. 

And that starts with taking a new approach to our relationship with ourselves.

This is why I want to introduce you to Carol. She’s the perfect example of how quickly you can improve the quality of your life when you learn to love yourself and develop Core Confidence.

Because if you’re still beating yourself up for things that you’ve done in the past, then you’re unintentionally sabotaging your happiness in the present AND in the future. 

Promise me you won’t waste any more time or energy. We’ve only got this one life to live.

(We’ve all heard the advice that confidence comes from “learning to love yourself,” but few ever learn how to do this. Carol learned how. Now you can too. I’ll see you in the video.)

Let’s start with this...

(this video is different from any video I’ve ever done. I’m really excited for you to see this.)

Vulnerability is hard for everyone. 

Whether you’re a man or a woman, we’re all terrified that if we show our true emotions or let someone see who we really are, we’ll get rejected. 

And while this struggle is universal, men have an extra layer of complexity because so many have been taught to believe that their value is in their ability to appear “strong.” 

Guys are programmed their whole lives to “man up,” be “tough,” and show that they’re an “alpha” if they want to be liked and respected. 

(Of course, women face plenty of unique challenges as well. But for the sake of this video, I’m focusing on the other half of the equation.)

While strong, masculine energy isn’t intrinsically a bad thing… it can get in the way of creating deep, lasting connections when men cling to outdated versions of it.

Here’s something to think about: Even when a guy wants to share things with you, he often feels deep down that the stakes are too high. 

He’s scared that if he voices his vulnerability, it will change the way you see him forever... that you’ll no longer view him as the attractive hero he wants to be, but instead as someone who is weak and undesirable. 

Now if you’re reading this email, it’s likely because you are open to seeing all sides of him. That you’re not just looking for some one-dimensional guy because you understand that vulnerability is the key to a deep, passionate connection. 

Which is why I recorded this video (stay to the end for a special announcement). 

And while it’s never your job to fix or solve a man’s problems for him, this is an opportunity to be one of his greatest allies in bringing out a side of him that no one else sees.

Not only will this allow you to get closer to him, but you’ll be giving him something that maybe no other woman has been capable of giving him before.

The best part? Every time he’s able to open up to you and have a positive experience, it’s another building block in your relationship. One that creates deep trust and makes you irreplaceable…

Stay to the end of the video for a special announcement that you won’t want to miss.

Want to know one of the most common and dangerous mistakes people make in dating?

(We’ve all done it. There’s a very high chance you are doing it right now.)

It’s called microdosing.

It’s when you like someone, and want more with them, but they’ve shown you (through their actions or their words) that they are not willing to give you more. They don’t want a relationship with you.

And yet, here you are, continuing to text them, speak to them on the phone, see them in person, and hook up with them.

If you can relate to this, watching this video is literally the most important thing you can do right now. And if someone you care about is in a pattern of microdosing someone right now, this video is the most important gift you could give to them, and could save them from a wasted life.

Imagine for a second that you’re 90 years old...

You’re replaying the movie of your life, reliving everything that you’ve experienced. 

(Are your memories full of intense love? Endless laughter? Heart-racing adventure? Real achievement?)

And now, think about this past week. 

How many times in the past week did you feel like you were moving towards that vision? 

For far too many people, the answer to that question will be that there wasn’t a single day when they were moving towards their dreams... 

If only because it seemed too scary to take action in the present, so they put it off for tomorrow.

But tomorrow never comes...

Today, I’m sharing the powerful story of a woman who spent far too long pushing love away because she didn’t think she deserved it.

Then, after spending 5 years healing from the loss of her divorce, suddenly turned her life around in just 6 days...

This video is proof that change can come quickly if you’re willing to stand up and meet the opportunity.

Because I know that I don’t want to be 90 years old and saying, “Well, I might not have gone after what I wanted, but at least I was safe.” 

And I bet you don’t want that to be the sum of your life either. 

I believe in you.

A toxic relationship can make you feel crazy. 

You might find yourself walking on eggshells…

Or avoiding situations that might start a fight…

Or at absolute worst… questioning your value (which is never acceptable).

So today I’m giving you 5 signs to know if the guy you’re dating is toxic...

Because look… sometimes when a relationship feels difficult, it’s because it is difficult. 

And while no one is perfect, the guy you give your time to should be a team player. 

Someone who consistently cheers you on. 

Someone who is invested in your happiness and your success. 

You deserve nothing less. 

(Toxic relationships can be confusing. If only because your feelings are real and you likely see some great qualities in your guy. But a man who’s worth keeping is one you never have to tiptoe around…)

This is an important message...

I need you to know that the journey you and I are on together in 2020 (and beyond) is about so much more than finding love. 

Because while a good portion of my content is about what to say and do in relationships…

At its core, what we’re really doing together is much deeper…

Because YOU are so much more than some lucky man’s future girlfriend or wife…

You’re a whole person with hopes and dreams and a purpose. 

And while I love hearing the success stories from women who have found the man they were looking for…

I get even more happiness from hearing about your stories of personal growth and self-love... 

Look, romantic relationships aren’t the end-all-be-all…

They’re just one aspect of a life worth living. 

And this year, I want us to commit to having a well-rounded life that we’re proud to share with the right person, not a life that is dependent on another person.

I post new dating advice for women every Sunday.

Can you relate to this?

I was recently coaching a woman who was frustrated with the texts she was getting from a guy who she’d met on a dating app. 

He wasn’t giving her a lot to work with, and she wanted to know if he was just a flirt or if there was the possibility for a real, deep connection.

So we looked at the texts together, and today I’m taking you behind the scenes of what she did right and what I would have changed to get her better results… 

Because while dating apps give us access to new people who we might not have met otherwise...

They also present the uniquely modern problem of trying to have real, meaningful conversations almost 100% online or via text with perfect strangers.

(Which can make it so much harder to tell someone’s intentions, especially in the early stages of dating.)

I have the solution right here...

Look, I’m not against dating apps. But it deeply concerns me how much time can be wasted on them if you don’t know how to a) sort through the duds, and b) position yourself for a real relationship with the right guys. 

This video will show you a technique that does both. Let me know what you think :).

""I’m not sure if I’m ready for a relationship with you right now...”
 
Nobody wants to hear these words.

Especially when it’s coming from a guy you genuinely like. 
 
Someone you’ve invested time and energy in... and someone you think could be THE person for you long term.

It leaves you wishing he could just get over his indecision… 
 
If that sounds familiar, then I have the simple solution right here:

Because, there IS a right way and a wrong way to handle this situation...
 
The wrong way is to try and convince him of all of the reasons you’re a great fit (even if all of these reasons are true). Because it can accidentally push him further away... 
 
The right way to handle this situation is to meet his confusion with love and kindness, but also strength and respect for yourself.

(Because here’s the crazy thing: this is actually a phenomenal opportunity to demonstrate YOUR status as a high-value woman who he risks losing… )

17 dates and he still won’t call you his girlfriend?

6 months of seeing each other and he’s getting mystery texts from some girl?

Whole weekends spent together only to have him ghost?

I don’t want to alarm you... but you may be dating an “MPI.”

Flakey… Armed with excuses… And guilty of the high crime of wasting your time…

MPI’s are some of the smoothest criminals...  

(Watch the video below for this critical bulletin...)

Suspicious that the guy you’re seeing could be an MPI? Then please, for your own sake, watch the video now. Too many good women have been robbed of years of their lives by dating an MPI… don’t be one of them.

Has this ever happened to you?
 
You’re on a first date... and...
 
He’s charming, handsome, and you feel like you have chemistry… 
 
But at the end of the night… he doesn’t ask for a second date (nevermind a third or fourth).
 
If this has happened to you (or keeps happening), you’re likely missing one of the two essential things that makes him reach across the table and say: 
 
“I’d really like to see you again.”
 
In this video, I tell you EXACTLY what to say so that he’ll ask you out again (and again, and again)... 
 
(You might be surprised at how simple this is AND how often you’re skipping this step when you’re interacting with a guy you like, especially in the early stages of dating...)
 
It’s genuinely crazy to me how obvious the phrase in this video is, how simple it would be for people to say, how many more second dates it would get them… and yet, they still aren’t doing it. I’m excited to read your thoughts in the comments.

Ever been hurt or betrayed?

Maybe someone broke your trust, cheated, or took your love for granted...

If so, I’m really sorry. 

The pain that can come from heartbreak is unlike anything else. It’s sickening.

But, there is something even more heartbreaking than heartbreak itself: Allowing the ghosts of the past to trick you into giving up on your next great love story.

If you’re finding it hard to open yourself up to love again…

If you are spending your life avoiding rejection right now instead of going after what you really want…

If being vulnerable and letting your guard down scares you to death…

This new video is for you.

It’s natural to want to protect your heart…

But if constantly playing defense is preventing you from meeting the REAL love of your life, you’ll never get to see just how much happiness your future still has in store for you.

Come on. We’ve got this, you and I. Let’s be courageous together. No more holding yourself back. 

Let’s live!

The holidays can be a magical time with those we love. 
 
They can also be a time when those we love ask us intensely awkward and annoying questions. 
 
Questions like...
 
“So, why are you still single?”
 
Find this question mildly triggering? 
 
And not just because it makes everyone within earshot feel awkward… but because it can unearth any anxieties YOU may have around your single status… 
 
Well, as always, I want to equip you with a powerful response to this question.
 
So in preparation for all of the family gatherings and holiday parties you might be going to, I shot this week’s video for you.
 
Because look... while Aunt Agnes (or co-worker Mike, or newly engaged Sally) should have a more tactful, and frankly more interesting, question to ask...
 
The REAL problem is that these questions are amplifying your own inner thoughts…
 
(And more than even having the right words to say, you want to have the right internal dialogue in response to this question.) I answer this in the video too.

There are just 39 days left until New Year’s Day.
 
(Can you believe it?)
 
As you look over 2019, do you feel like you’ve accomplished your goals? 
 
(Maybe you wanted to take that bike trip across Italy, or have a career breakthrough, or finally attract your high-caliber guy…)
 
Or, do you look at the past year and see that there are still hopes and dreams that are unfinished or even untouched? 
 
I get it. It happens to the best of us. 
 
Because with every exciting goal comes resistance… 
 
A feeling of dread or overwhelm that tricks us into thinking that transforming our lives is IMPOSSIBLE (even though we're more than capable of making it happen).
 
In this video I tell you EXACTLY how to go after your goals, without letting fear stop you...

Falling in “like” with someone can happen in a flash. 
 
On the heels of a thoughtful gesture. After a witty joke that sends you into belly laughs. When he looks at you with a flirtatious energy that wasn’t there before... 
 
And while liking someone is an electric feeling that signals the potential for something exciting... it can also trick us into looking past bad behaviors that we wouldn’t normally tolerate…
 
(It’s one of the primary reasons we get hurt more than we need to when we’re out there dating.) 
 
Not to worry. In the video below, I explain WHY we sometimes let red flags slide and the simple mindset shift that will help protect your heart while you’re looking for your ultimate partner.
 
Listen, we’ve all been there. It’s tempting to let infatuation be our guide. But no one, no matter how dazzling, is worth our sacrificing our long-term happiness. This is an essential shift in mindset that I cover in the video.

As your coach, it’s important for me to remind you that you get to set the tone for what you will and won’t accept. I know from helping thousands of women find love that setting these boundaries will open the door to better treatment and better men.

Are you experiencing heartbreak? 

Many mistakenly think heartbreak only occurs from long-term relationships ending. But it can also occur when someone we were seeing casually suddenly disappears or stops seeing us. 

When the feelings are strong, the pain is acute, whether you’ve known this person for 6 weeks or 6 years. But what rarely changes is the answer to heartbreak…

When you get your heart broken, there are two paths you can take:

(1) The path of despair – this is the story where you tell yourself you’ve lost your soulmate and nothing will make you happy ever again.

(2) The path of recovery – this is the story where you choose to turn pain into power – where you fight your way back to the light, to love, to self-care, to feeling whole again.

If you’re feeling the pain of heartbreak right now, this week’s video will put you on the path of recovery. There’s a high chance you’ll instantly feel a little better after watching it. 

Don’t suffer unnecessarily…

It’s hard to find love when you don’t feel loveable yourself.

When you know you’ve made a ton of mistakes. Or you’ve internalized the idea that you’re just not a likeable person.

It becomes a self-perpetuating cycle: “I don’t like myself, so why should anyone else like me?” Then we feel lonely, beat ourselves up, feel like a failure, and like ourselves even less than before.

We retreat more and more into our shell and lose that “spark” that makes us attractive to someone else as a potential partner.

This is exhausting. It’s unfair. And it doesn’t do justice to who you really are on the inside and everything you have to give to the world.

It’s an overwhelming step to think about how to suddenly become supremely confident. So let’s do something more modest today. In this video, I want to share a small thing you can start doing today to get back your self-esteem and begin to reclaim your core confidence...

When people talk about “the secret to a great relationship,” they always mention the same things:

- “You have to communicate”
- “Respect is the key”
- “Never go to bed angry”
 
All of these things may be part of the puzzle.
 
But I bet you’ve never thought about relationships the way I’m about to show you. 
 
The secret I give in this video isn’t one you’ll find in every book out there…
 
Not only that, but if you’ve been questioning whether the person you’ve been seeing (even casually) and obsessing over is the person you’re supposed to be with, it’ll help you answer that too...

What’s the deal?
 
When someone you like disappears and then reappears, it’s easy to find yourself in a dilemma about what to do. You think, “Do I ignore him to teach him a lesson? Do I play it cool and pretend it was no big deal? Or do I show that I’m hurt that he disappeared?”

(It’s new video time, baby :). Can’t wait for you to see this one.)
 
You may have been taught that when the right person shows up, you’ll just know it.
 
But then how do we find ourselves in situations in life where we fall really hard for the wrong people – people who hurt us, people who are toxic, people who don’t love us back? And what does this say about the dangers of “love at first sight”?
 
If you keep getting yourself hurt in love…
 
… if you’re someone who falls too hard too fast…
 
… if you’re someone whose imagination runs away with them the moment you meet someone you like...
 
… then video is for you. It’s going to completely change your perspective on early dating. It’ll also massively reduce any nerves, anxiety, or overthinking you have when you meet someone you like (remember, these things stop you from putting your best self forward and makes it far more likely you’ll get hurt).

Are you sick of people who are less kind, less talented, less driven, or have worked less at being a good person than you getting handed opportunities in love and business that you know YOU deserve more?
 
You’re right. It’s not fair. 
 
The bad news is, there will always be people with inferior personalities or products who will get further ahead than they deserve. 
 
But the good news is, there IS a secret YOU can learn that will make you stand out from everyone, especially in today’s world full of noise…
 
Maybe you’re still telling yourself, “I’m just not the kind of person who can attract the person I want, inspire a crowd, be a leader, or get noticed for my work. You just need to be born with that talent and charisma.”
 
Wrong. Wrong. Wrong.
 
As a former shy kid (and still to this day a pretty big introvert) who now does world speaking tours and makes videos for millions of viewers every week – believe me – this ability can be learned. 
 
If you’re ready to stop hiding and finally have the impact you deserve, learn this essential skill and start getting results today...

Yeah, I said it.

Have you ever been in love with someone who doesn’t share your feelings? 

You live in hope that one day they’ll light up your phone with a text that says how much they can’t live without you. 

Or, you fantasize that they’ll leave their partner and run back into your arms. They’ll say what a fool they’ve been and how much they need you by their side.

It’s romantic, right?

Nope.

And this kind of “perpetual hope” can be so dangerous for your relationships that I feel I have to say something to anyone out there still waiting for a crush to change their mind. 

Before you give your heart to someone who doesn’t deserve it today, please watch this video. 

It could save years of your life...

It’s new video time, baby.

I’ve been on tour over the last month and you wouldn’t believe how many women have asked me how to get a guy to just call them.
 
We seem to live on our phones in 2019, and yet it seems no one ever wants to actually speak on them.
 
We’re happy to text, Snap, post our thoughts on Twitter, and message on Instagram, but actually having a conversation where you hear someone’s voice? Well, that’s just too much to ask.
 
Or is it?
 
I’ve seen women make this sooo complicated, so let’s step back and make it really easy. 
 
If you’re sick of texting endlessly and want to actually talk and create real connection, here are 3 killer techniques to get him to pick up the phone and call you...

Isn’t it exhausting to be out there meeting guys, going on dates, and always coming home disappointed?
 
You smile and fake-laugh at his jokes. But you already knew within 10 minutes that you didn’t feel any chemistry. Plus, he’s not as funny as he was in his text messages. Or you get on a date and find he’s just arrogant in person. 
 
This is what it feels like to waste time in finding love. 
 
Then we ask ourselves: “Do I really want to bother with this? It’s so frustrating and pointless.”
 
If you’re suffering from dating burnout, then I want you to listen closely. In this video, I share my simple strategy that lets you filter out the wrong men quickly so that you get to Mr. Right waaayy faster...

Ever notice how you completely fall apart when you try to speak to that guy you’re really attracted to?

It’s like with your best friends you can be effortlessly funny, talkative, and smart, then suddenly you’re talking to this guy and your brain turns to mush.

Then begins the negative self-talk:

“I’m not pretty enough,” “I have nothing interesting to say,” “He’s not going to like me.”

It’s like you instantly lose all of your game.

You go into “impress” mode. You over-analyze everything you say. You get in your head. Instead of just having fun in the moment, you start playing it cautious, like you’re in a game of chess and the stakes are life and death.

If you want to finally stop putting guys on a pedestal and instill new empowering beliefs that will make you bring your best to the table (no matter who you’re talking to) watch this week’s video before you do anything else...

Most of you know that I hold my Retreat program twice a year in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Well, last October something very special happened at the Retreat. At the time, it was only something that was witnessed by people in the room…

But it was so powerful I needed the rest of the world to see it. 

If you are in a place today where feel you’ve lost hope...

If you are overwhelmed by the struggles in your life…

If your confidence has been eroded or completely crushed by too many let downs, too much pain…

Or if life has recently thrown you a massive curveball that has left you feeling lower than you’ve ever felt...

I need you to watch this video. Right. Now. 

Let it be the catalyst that brings you back to life, shows you what’s possible and all there is to be excited about in your life right now, no matter what is going on. 

This was a moment I’ll never forget from my Retreat, I have a feeling it might make you feel the same way...

When is the right time to sleep with a guy?

How do we create positive culture around sex, devoid of shame and judgment, and also be aware of whether our actions are leading us to the outcome we want with a person?

Some people offer a magic formula or rule...

“If you wait for 3, 5, 10 dates, then he’ll take you seriously.”

We know these kinds of arbitrary rules are silly and artificially constraining.

There isn’t some ideal “waiting period” before you should have sex with someone. 

Yet I also 100% believe that, if you’re looking for something serious, then there are certain things you should ask yourself before jumping into bed and being intimate (especially if you know yourself well enough to know that it is something you’ll regret if it doesn’t lead anywhere).

This topic often creates a lot of confusion, so I wanted to clarify some of my thoughts on it...

New video alert! Really excited for you all to see this one! Why do so many people not get the attention from men they deserve? They don’t get approached, they don’t get asked on dates...and when they do go on dates they don’t go anywhere! 

Today, I’m going to talk about a very subtle behavior shift you can make in the early stages of meeting and dating that will radically increase the number of opportunities you have for a relationship.

Have you ever been so frustrated by a guy’s mixed signals that you just decided to finally confront him and ask where you stand?

It’s a scary moment. 

You feel like you’ve thrown your heart into the air, and you’re hoping he’ll run to catch it instead of letting it fall and splat on the ground and make a huge mess. (I know, not the loveliest metaphor I’ve ever written…)

And then…

He replies.

You hear his words. Read his text message:

“Hey, I think you’re amazing and have such a great time with you. I really hope we can make things work and I’ll think about what you said.”

Huh?

If you’ve ever had an answer like this, in today’s video I’ll tell you exactly what this “guy language” means so that you know how to confidently respond to this message...

It’s scary in 2019 how much we are in a crisis of loneliness.

More than ever, people are finding it hard to make time for friends, spend quality time with loved ones, or go out to meet a new romantic prospect.

We get stuck on dating apps, endless internet browsing, and casual connections that leave us feeling empty and hollow. 

If you really want to make your love life great, an essential ingredient is creating the right social support...

See how in today’s new video...

Are you struggling emotionally today?

If the answer is yes, then let’s talk.

There are so many self-help messages of positivity out there telling you how to be your #BestSelf, reach your potential, and become a peak performer.

But what if you just feel awful right now? You’ve been through pain, hurt, feeling low, and you barely can bother to leave the house.

This video is for you...

Have you ever noticed how when one part of your life falls apart, it can suddenly bring your entire self-worth crashing to the ground?

For example:

“I lost my job. Without my fancy career, I feel like a total failure.”

“I lost my relationship. If I don’t have that guy in my life, I feel undesirable, alone, and worthless.”

“I lost my cool social group/I moved to a place where no one knows me. I feel like a loser with no friends and no life.” 

There are so many sudden shocks that can tear apart the fabric of who we thought we were.

But you know what? 

That doesn’t mean these changes should destroy our confidence. In fact, these moments are exactly what confidence is for in the first place. 

If you’re tired of feeling your self-worth crumble every time a guy flakes on you, or your career faces a setback, or you find yourself alone, it’s time to finally take the steps to get deep core confidence. 

Here’s how it works...

Have you ever had a guy see you as just his “buddy,” instead of the kind of woman he wants to date and make his girlfriend?

It’s easy to think that it’s because there’s some huge part of your personality that is pushing guys away.

But in truth, it may just be that you need to add just 10% extra flirtation to your interactions when you meet that guy you really like.

In this video, you’ll see that it’s not about having to be the most sexual woman in the room, or having to get physical earlier than you’re comfortable with. 

It just requires you to show another side of yourself that you may not be used to showing. 

Here’s how to do it...

I had a conversation on my latest Fast Track session that I really wanted to share with you. The client who shared this story with us graciously gave us permission to share it with you so that you can benefit as well.

It’s a totally relatable scenario with a woman who found herself suspicious because of a text message she received from her boyfriend.

Her question is one I get so often: “Am I being irrational and jealous? Or is it OK for me to be upset about this?”

When you’re in the moment, it can be so hard to tell, especially if there seem to be red flags right in front of you.

In this video, I share my reaction to this text, and give you a clear way to say what you really feel in this difficult situation...

It’s so easy to take ourselves too seriously. 

And yet…

That’s how we miss out on so much of life. 

Today, I talk to my wonderful friend Karen Rinaldi, who has written a book all about how attractive it can be to suck at something.

 I highly recommend her book. “It’s Great To Suck At Something”. I read it cover to cover and it’s already changing my life. 

“It’s Great to Suck at Something” by Karen Rinaldi

Last week I opened the doors on my brand new “Attraction To Commitment” program, and I’m honestly blown away by the amazing response we had within just a couple of days. :D :D

The 1000 places on the insider bonuses are totally sold out, and my team and I couldn’t be happier with how many women have said “yes” to getting a real relationship and taking the next step with us. 

Seriously, we worked incredibly hard on this, and this program represents the cutting-edge of content I’ve worked on for the last decade of my life. 

It means everything to me to know we have a community of women here who aren’t just talking about change, but who are actually ready to do something about it. 

I can’t wait to hear your stories as you apply the content in the program (and am truly grateful to those who have sent kind words about the changes they are  already making since they got their copy).

Thank you, thank you, thank you :) 

----

Now, on to today’s topic.

If you’ve been in the early dating stages with a guy, you may have noticed after a few weeks when you get one of those “uh-oh” moments. 

Maybe he doesn’t call when he said he would. Or he’s a little ignorant about something that’s important to you. Or appeared to take something you did for granted. 

It might not be terrible behavior, but you know it’s behavior you don’t want to be a pattern for the rest of your relationship. 

So how do you handle the conversation without letting your emotions get the better of you? I.e. without reacting in a way that would hurt rather than help the relationship...

In this week’s video, I’m going to give 3 steps of exactly how to handle this difficult conversation, so that can handle it in a productive way when it happens.

This is how you make him want to be a better man for you...

New video is out now!!!

The response to my last video about the stages of commitment has been truly incredible, and I want to sincerely thank you for all your heartfelt and honest messages. 

My team and I have read hundreds of your responses, and we couldn’t be more moved and excited about the number of women who are ready to say “no” to being stuck in the casual trap, and YES to something REAL.

I’ve talked a lot this last week about how the toxicity of today's dating culture, combined with the fear of being alone, has people lowering their standards to the point where it is impossible to get the respect or commitment they truly deserve. 

In today’s video you’re going to see an REAL example of exactly that.

It’s a powerful video that I believe is going to make A LOT of you question your own situation. Please make sure you stay until the end because I have a special surprise for you this week. If you are ready for something real in your life, you won’t want to miss this...

I truly think this is one of the most important concepts I’ve ever talked about.

Look, no one ever sets out to spend their life alone or waste time stuck in relationship limbo.

It happens slowly, almost imperceptibly, one ignored red flag and one dropped standard at a time.

Yet every single day, I meet a woman who is consumed with remorse for the precious time she can’t get back. Days, months, even years that added up as she just WAITED and HOPED it would all work out.

But you can’t GAMBLE your happiness on chance and hope.

The lie we’re told is that life will be a fairy tale all on its own. It won’t.

The truth is, we CAN have the fairy tale, but we’re responsible for creating it. 🏰

Stop WAITING for a man to come save you and give you your happily ever after. Stop gambling with your happiness. Stop hoping things will magically change on their own.

Take control of your happily ever after. Please watch this video. I can’t wait to read your thoughts in the comments below!

Do you feel like you have “dating burnout”? Like modern single life is a treadmill of flaky guys, false hope and meaningless hookups?

Well, you’re not alone.

It’s easy in 2019 to feel like we’re in the worst possible time to be single. 

Dating apps make people feel like they have endless choices. Men and women seem to both be seeking unrealistic levels of perfection. 

You may feel like just to even hold a guy’s attention you have to drop your standards for his behavior and accept second-best treatment. 

This. Has. To. Stop.

Have you ever met a guy you really liked, and spent weeks terrified you were going to blow it?

You’d analyze with your friends every text he sent. You’d worry when he’d go silent for several hours, constantly checking your phone, looking for signs of hope.

Suddenly, you become a person you weren’t before: needy, anxious, possessive – and you could feel that energy making you more and more helpless.

I know what this is like, and trust me: if you ever want to keep a great relationship and not play games, you need to get out of this mindset fast. 

Here’s how you change it...

Do you find that men only ever seem to chase you for sex?

I’ve had hundreds of women ask me what to do when guys just see them as a sexual object, and the answer is twofold:

(a) Cut off the wrong men faster

(b) Don’t allow him to put you in one category

There’s nothing wrong with being flirtatious and making a guy attracted to you sexually (after all, at least he is attracted to you). But it is much harder to get long-term attraction if you’re only flirty. 

In this video, I show a listener live in my Fast Track webinar Q&A how she can make a guy crazy for her personality and not just her body, by making some simple small shifts in her approach to her interactions with him. 

This is how you inspire real emotional attraction in a guy, instead of just physical lust...

In my programs I often talk about what makes a woman irreplaceable to a man. 

What does that one woman who seems to effortlessly get into relationships and have men wanting to marry her possess that other women don’t?

See, it’s true that men have different tastes when it comes to a woman’s looks or personality.

But despite their preferences, they are also drawn to 4 incredibly attractive traits in a woman, and when you show them in the first or second date, he’ll be that much more likely to see you as someone he can’t imagine himself without. 

If you want the 101 on what men really think, this is where to start...

You know what drives me soooo crazy?

Hearing men and women repeat the same dumb myths about relationships over and over again. 

And I don’t blame anyone for believing them. 

The fact is that society, romantic movies, and even our friends and family are responsible for spreading certain “facts” about love and dating that just aren’t true. 

So today, I teamed up with my brother Stephen Hussey (co-writer of the ""Get The Guy"" book) to break down the top 5 annoying dating myths that need to end now. 

This is a fun one – can’t wait for you to see it…

It always surprises me how often a potentially great relationship is cut short because of silly mistakes and insecure behaviors that we haven’t learned to control.

“But doesn’t love solve everything?”

Well, not exactly. 

What often happens is that these toxic behaviors slowly poison every chance at love we find (or at least make the search so much harder than it should be). 

So in this week’s video, I want to share exactly what the 3 most common behaviors are that scare a guy off before he ever gets a chance to truly fall for you. 

Avoid these and you’ll find it way easier to get a guy hooked on your best qualities and have a healthy, happy relationship...

When you’re in love and a guy decides to end a relationship, it’s natural for your brain to go into “panic mode.""

Why is he doing this? How can I be the person he wants me to be? What can I say to get him back?

If you allow these swirling thoughts to get the better of you, you’ll only end up pushing him further and further away.

Now, I’m not going to tell you whether or not you should give it another try with your ex. There are many factors to decide that we can talk about another time.

But what I *do* know is that if you want to have a real chance of getting this guy back in your life, you must understand this important truth before you take the next step...

One thing no one ever warns you about happy relationships is just how many awkward conversations they can require you to have.

And despite all the big ones of politics, religion and family – I find one topic almost no one wants to talk about is money. 

Who should pay on a date? Should you be honest with your partner how much money (or debt) you have? How do you handle it when one of you earns significantly higher income in a relationship than the other?

These are all hugely important, and yet most people bury their heads in the sand and hope these issues will magically work themselves out if you’re truly in love (pro tip: they won’t).

So in this week’s video, I sat down with my good friend Ramit Sethi, bestselling author and CEO of ""I Will Teach You To Be Rich,"" to learn exactly how to have these difficult conversations so you can feel happy and secure about money in your relationship.

I’ve never talked about this before, so I can’t wait to hear your comments on this one...

I want to know: Are you really brave enough to have the difficult conversations in your relationships?

Most people aren’t.

They’ll stay in an awkward “almost relationship” for years instead of asking for what they want. 

They’ll avoid having an honest conversation about their feelings, for fear of being seen as a drama queen. 

They’ll decide to hold in their concerns for the future, so they aren’t thought of as “needy” or “difficult.” 

I’ve had women come to my seminars who are 10x more honest with my team than they have ever been with the man they are dating. Isn’t that strange? That we would rather share our worries with strangers than with the person we’re supposed to be in love with?

In this video, you’ll see exactly why it’s so damaging to hide from difficult conversations, and learn how to finally have the talk you desperately need...

You see the popular person at the center of the party. Or maybe just your friends, letting loose and holding court with ease. Yet, you’re standing alone. 

“It’s hopeless,” you think. “I’m just not the sort of person that people pay attention to.” 

Over the last decade of speaking to women about their love lives, I’ve been deeply shocked and saddened by how many people see themselves fundamentally as low-value.

Women whose self-esteem has been eroded by parents, by mean kids or teenagers at school, by relationships with men who gradually made them feel insecure and worthless. 

That’s why I know 100% there is nothing, nothing more important for your love life than truly, at the deepest level, having love and respect for yourself. 

And when you learn to honestly value what you have to offer, and tap into your own unique, passionate energy, the ability to get yourself noticed (romantically or otherwise) is easier than you could ever imagine.

Here’s how to start knowing your value...

You may have told yourself 100 times you’re ready to finally meet someone. Maybe you even read a few dating tips and decided to go try them out.

But then, you see that cute guy you like at work, in your social circle, or at a party. 

You want to flirt. You want to get him to notice you. Then at the crucial moment, you shrink.

“H--hey”, you say, trying to play it cool. 

You make small talk. Chit-chat about everyday stuff, but nothing that ever amounts to flirting. 

And you realize: I can’t do this. I’m too much of an introvert. 

If you’ve ever used this excuse before, then get ready. Because I have 3 techniques today that are going to change your dating life forever. 

You’re an introvert? Guess what, so am I. Now you’ll find out why that can be your greatest superpower...

Are you one of those people who dreads Valentine's Day?

Whether they're single or in a relationship, people have all kinds of reasons for wanting to skip February 14th:

There’s too much pressure to be romantic.

It’s all about money and gifts.

Single people are made to feel like failures.

It would be easy for me to say all the reasons Valentine’s isn’t worth the trouble. 

But I think we can all make this an event we actually enjoy instead of dread. First, you need to avoid some of the big mistakes people make when approaching the day (and their whole dating life). 

Avoid these 5 traps, and you’ll be on your way to fulfilling love at any time of year...

You know, people make flirting so complicated.

Especially for women. 

There are so many outdated rules, like this one: You have to wait for a guy to approach you. 

Why? Because otherwise you'll look ""too easy""? Because it's less risky if you hold back and sheepishly make eye contact? 

Well, today I have a flirting technique that brilliantly overcomes both of these objections (and puts you in the power position). 

So if you're tired of endlessly swiping on Tinder and not being able to speak to that cute guy at the bar/party/bookstore (you know, in real life), here is your new weapon...

Hey, 

How is 2019 going so far? 

Perhaps already you’re asking yourself: “Am I going to achieve my goals for the year?”

Am I going to lose weight? Get my finances organized? Will I take the necessary steps to improve my relationships (or start dating if I’m single?)

Often, you see people get super excited on January 1st (OK, January 2nd, when they’re less hungover). They make New Year’s resolutions (usually too many). They set huge goals without thinking about how they’ll actually make them happen. 

Then reality kicks in. 

They realize change is tough. Change is scary. Change asks us to do things that at first feel uncomfortable, almost alien. It forces us to change or rethink our priorities to make room for new goals. 

If you’ve had a shaky start to the year, and you’re already feeling intimidated about getting off track, it’s not too late.

Stop the self-flagellation and get on the path to making this your proudest, most accomplished year ever. Watch this now…

I'm wondering: Have you ever started dating a guy, realized he ticked a lot of your boxes (confident, smart, adventurous, well-traveled, family-loving, hot), and then got totally ahead of yourself?

You thought: ""This is amazing. He's amazing. We're going to be amazing!""

Fast forward 3 weeks...

You're hanging out with your friends, waiting for a text that never comes. He didn't reply to your last message from three days ago. Why? What did you say wrong? How can you stop him from slipping away? Whhhhyyyy is this happening?

Stop.

In this video, I'll tell you why he's going cold, what to do about it, and how to break this cycle so you never repeat the same mistake in the future...

90% of people are making a mistake in the way they connect with other people without even realizing it. 

See, ever since I was 13 and first picked up my Dad’s copy of the Dale Carnegie’s How To Win Friends And Influence People, I was fascinated with figuring what it is that allows certain people able to influence, attract, and be charismatic in the presence of others. 

Over years of being on TV and radio, running a company with over 30 full-time staff, and speaking to audiences of thousands of people, I’ve learned some really important distinctions that make people certain people immediately compelling.

I’ve also learned some major things people get wrong that must be avoided at all costs if you ever want to win people over… (more on that in the video)

So here it is, my #1 secret to getting people hooked in the first 60 seconds…

Your head is lightly resting on his shoulder. When you both talk, your faces get closer and closer. 

Heart racing? Check. Lipstick applied? Check. 

Now you’re just waiting for the moment: Is he going to just freaking kiss me already?? 

It’s a moment that you feel instinctively on a date. The moment you know you’re ready for it to happen. 

But that doesn’t mean he’ll always go for it…

So if you’re tired of dates that end with little more than a friendly hug outside the taxi home, it’s time to step things up a notch...

When you get your heartbroken, who do you turn to for advice?

Family? Friends? Trawling around Reddit forums to see what other fellow sufferers have to say about your pain?

All of this may help. Maybe.

It struck me recently how we’re never really taught how to move on from the agony of losing someone we love. And if we’re not careful, following the behavior of the people around us can make us feel even worse. 

So… let’s pause. Take a breath. Get our s**t together again. 

It’s nearly 2019. Maybe you’re missing someone right now as the holidays roll around. 

But now is not the time to mourn. Now is the time to truly begin your healing and put yourself back together before next year begins.

Here’s what you need to know to finally move on…

It’s your final 10 seconds. What are you going to do?

I know this year has had difficulties. (Hey, this is life after all.) 

You’ve worked and tried and faced struggles… but maybe you’ve had some magical moments along the way too. Maybe even some romance. ;)

But 2018 isn’t over yet. 

If, like me, you’re someone who is planning to really squeeze the most possible juice out of 2019, and make it the year when you take a mega leap forward in your career, finances, dating, or health, I need you to hear this message while there’s still time.

Let’s not wait for a second longer to find love and happiness...

Many times I have heard the phrases:

“Men are just the worst today. They only value sex and nothing else.”

“Dating is a toxic minefield where everyone is entitled and out for themselves.”

“I give up. No one wants to invest in a serious relationship anymore.”
    
I hear you.

Do you ever feel like an invisible force is holding you back from getting what you really want in your life and relationships?

Maybe that force has a name: fear, uncertainty, doubt…

I’ve seen people with all the talent, beauty, and great personality traits in the world lose out on amazing people and opportunities because they have a terrible relationship with these forces. 

Instead of leaning into fear, they step away…

Instead of embracing uncertainty, they hide…

Instead of turning doubt into certainty, they shield themselves…

In this week’s video, I’m giving you a very special treat: a breakdown of confidence from one of my most cherished mentors, my boxing trainer, Mr. Martin Snow.

If you are sick and tired of running and are still scared of putting yourself on the line in love, stop whatever you’re doing now and listen to this...

Breakups are painful, and if we’re honest, rarely clean.

We think of the end of a relationship as a simple path: Someone’s feelings change, they initiate “the conversation,” you both say goodbye, and then begins the heartbreak along with piles of junk food and bad TV. 

But we know that breakups can be waayyy messier than that. 

They can last weeks, even months. You think it’s over, then two weeks later you’re in the same bed together. Or you keep hanging out. Maybe you get the odd phone call saying he misses you and you’re totally confused about where you stand.

This is common, but it doesn’t mean it’s healthy. 

So if you’re still wondering why your ex seems to still linger around, make sure you follow these steps...

There’s a myth about confidence that it’s something you can just magically think yourself into.

Ever heard these phrases:

“Just love yourself”

“What you believe, you become”

“Thinking makes it so”

Now, I appreciate more than anyone the power of inner psychology. 

I’m the guy who runs a 5-day retreat where I focus entirely on techniques to re-wire our brain to change our ugly thought patterns.

Yes, the process of deeply loving yourself is a long one. But boosting your confidence is something you can do right now, without any therapy, books, or spiritual mantras.

I have to tell you a surprising fact about men. 

Because it’s not something you’ll notice, or frankly, something that most men will admit, even to themselves.

See, men have been taught their entire lives that they need to be in control. That they have to be stoic, unflappable under pressure, especially in front of women. Even more especially in front of women they date.

And yet…

There’s a secret test every guy is waiting to see if a woman passes in the early dating stage. (And it shows that men are waayy more vulnerable than you may have ever imagined.) 

And the answer to this question will 100% determine if he sees you as someone he can be with long-term. 

 Make sure you have the right answer…

Ever avoided having a conversation with a guy because you’re afraid of the answer?

You cringe at having to speak those cliche 4 words, “Where is this going?”

Is it the right moment to ask yet? Will he think you’re being pushy?

Too many women choose to carry on and just go with their feelings. And I get it. It’s fun. It’s romantic. But it can also leave you with a nasty surprise later when you realize you’re both not on the same page.

So, let’s make a deal: no more avoiding. 

Let’s take power back, and stop allowing decisions to be made for us...

How is it you can be made so unhappy by someone you’re not even dating?

How can you fall into the trap of pursuing someone who isn’t really in love with you? 

Easy. 

Even if all of our friends and family know we are pursuing the wrong thing, we’ll hold onto hope because we live for the “maybe.”

“Maybe he’ll come around. Maybe he secretly does love me. Maybe he’ll change his feelings.”

We feed on the tiniest scraps of attention – a text, a conversation, some kind words and affection he gives before going cold and pulling away again.

But this is a recipe for misery.

I don’t want you to build on what could maybe happen in an imaginary future, I want you to invest in an amazing guy who is serious about you right now. 

Here’s how to do it...

Ever had a guy who keeps you just on the edge? Who swings between making you feel like he wants no one else in the world, and suddenly pulling away and freaking out?

Yep, it’s totally normal.

And today, I’m going to reveal an exclusive video clip from a live seminar where you’ll see me in a Q&A dealing with a woman who went through this exact situation.

It’s easy to assume in these moments that you’re the problem. Or to think that you somehow have to figure out what’s going on his head and convince him of the right choice.

Instead, I want you to do this...

Your phone buzzes. He’s texted you back. Great, right?

Right??

Well, it depends.

I’ve seen too many women fall into the trap of thinking that a guy is chasing simply because he sends a few Whatsapp messages.

The truth is, if you know the signs to look for, it’s pretty clear if he’s just messing around, or if he’s serious about pursuing you. 

Use these red flags as your guide and you’ll instantly know what he really wants...

You might not realize it, but so many mistakes in your past relationships probably came from a lack of self-esteem. 

Unreasonable jealousy. Fear of abandonment. Being needy and trying to control your man’s time and behavior (which only makes him pull away more).

And it’s all because of the C-word.

Confidence. 

Most people fake it. Or they confuse it with other things: money, status, fame, a fancy lifestyle etc.  

But the deep, inner, core confidence I reveal in this video is what’s left when everything else is stripped away.

It’s the ultimate power, and it’s available to everyone: if you’re willing to make a profound emotional change in the way you see yourself.

Here’s what you need to do to get it...

Many women make the mistake of thinking men are really simple when it comes to the bedroom.

But actually, there’s a huge difference between “normal sex” and what truly blows his mind. 

I know what you’re thinking: ""Doesn’t every guy have different tastes, though?"" That’s true, which is why it’s nearly impossible to generalize when it comes to technique, style, positions etc.

But there are certain universal attractive behaviors that make for a much better sex life regardless of your individual preferences. 

When you understand them, you’re much more likely to become someone he can’t get enough of (physically and emotionally). 

And isn’t that something we all want for our partner at the end of the day?

So here it is, my ultimate bedroom tips that make you a woman he won’t soon forget. ;)

Picture this scenario. 

You’ve been dating a new guy for a month. You bring him to a friend’s birthday, when all of a sudden you bump into a guy you used to hook up with. Cue awkward conversation. 

When he leaves, your man turns to you and asks, “Who was that?”

Eeek.

Do you give him the 100% honest answer? Or the 50% sort-of-honest answer? 

It’s a tricky situation, and one that causes way too many unnecessary problems in new relationships.

So today, I want to give you an exact response that will save you hours of annoying jealous conversations with any guy...

I think it’s time I finally talked honestly about this.

For years now, I’ve read comments asking the question: 

“Matt, are some guys just not ready for commitment? Why? What’s holding him back? Will he change?”

As a woman, this can be so annoying. It can even seem downright unfair. 

You meet an amazing guy, you can tell he’s really into you, and yet he gives you the “I just want to have fun” speech. 

Yes, it sucks. 

But I believe knowledge is power - and understanding why men behave this way will help make it so much easier to walk away from situations where he’s never going to change his mind. 

So here is the real truth about why he won’t commit...

Have you ever heard that annoying Marilyn Monroe quote: “If you can’t handle me at my worst, you don’t deserve me at my best”?

(Yes, I know. There’s no evidence she actually ever said it. But people quote this all the time as if it’s some kind of profound wisdom).

And you know what?

It’s wrong. So wrong. 

People love any kind of relationship advice that tells them, “Hey, you know those crazy faults you have, like, the really crazy ones? They’re fine. And any man who cares about you needs to accept them.”

In today’s video, I’ll show you why it’s incredibly dangerous to follow this advice. 

And then, I’ll show you how to avoid the most destructive habits that make men pull away so that you can win the right guy back again...

There’s something I’m guilty of rarely talking about in my content that I think it’s time to address.

And when I look back, it’s crazy I haven’t made a video about it before, considering how many times woman have asked this question.

Well, consider this the moment where I finally address the elephant in the room.

I’ve read countless complaints that go something like this: “Matt, I just don’t meet any guys I actually find attractive.”

Or even more severe: “I can’t find a guy who I consider relationship-worthy for me. Maybe I’m destined to be alone...”

I understand that fear, but I also know that this is a dangerous psychology trap, one I’ve seen men and women of all ages fall into.

If you feel like no guy is quite what you’re looking for, this is how to solve it...

Let me tell you the real reason you’re afraid to fall for a guy.

You’re terrified of rejection.

Maybe you’ve put yourself on the line before. Only to have that guy turn around and later say, “I’m just not feeling it.”

Or you’ve tried flirting with that cute guy from work, only to hear, “I just see you as a friend.”

The sad part is: We get one “no” in life, and allow it to prevent us from getting the “yes” of our dreams.

I don’t want you to hide anymore. I don’t want you to live in fear. I don’t want you to ever give someone the power to feel less than your worth.

So before you do anything else today, I need you to hear this...

So, I want to know what flirting means to you. 

Does it mean seductively glancing over the bar whilst caressing a cocktail glass?

Does it mean subtly leaning over so that he smells your perfume?

Or does it mean asking him where the bathroom is, sheepishly turning away, and then walking off to the other side of the room and hoping he just “gets” that you like him?

I’ve noticed that when it comes to flirting: everyone has a different idea of what it is in their head. And too many people make it so complicated. 

So I want to give you the 3 crucial, foolproof flirting tips that any women can use to get a guy’s attention.

If you’re out of practice, this is where to start...

How do you get a guy to come over and talk to you?

I’ve been talking about dating a long time, but this eternal female dilemma never goes away: “I want to talk to that hot guy, but I don’t want to look desperate...What can I do??”

Fear not.

Because the truth is, this puzzle was already solved 200 years ago. 

This is hard-won wisdom, and now this secret technique is about to be yours too. 

Never again will you have to stand at the bar, clutching a cocktail, waiting for him to say “hi”...

I want to ask you something, and it’s a little personal. 

    Well, two things actually...

#1 Are you single? 

#2 On a scale of 1-10, how happy are you currently with your dating life?

The reason I ask is because, you may have noticed, so many women treat being single like it’s a sad, tragic place to be.

Or you ask them about their dating life and they groan: “Ugh...you mean watching Netflix and eating takeout while I get asked for nudes on Tinder?”

It doesn’t have to be this way. 

So even if you’ve been through heartbreak and loneliness, I’m going to give you my top 3 strategies to get back in the game and find love again...

Your phone buzzes. It’s a text from him ;) 

You can feel your stomach flip over with excitement. Every message he sends is like sweet honey for your brain. “Damn”, you think, “I’m an addict.”

And then you fire a cute message back. And you wait...and wait…

“Why isn’t he replying?” you want to scream to your friend on the couch next to you. But she’s too busy with her phone to notice. 

You try to shift focus, but you obsessively check for a text every 30 seconds. 

Sound familiar?

We’ve all had this agony of “anxious waiting” with someone we like. It’s distracting, it’s unattractive, and it drains you of your peace of mind every minute you sit in limbo. 

If you’re sick of waiting for his text and want to finally take back your power, watch this...

Do you ever wish your man would talk more dirty to you? Ever wondered how to get him to act out your fantasies?

I’m always shocked by how many women avoid having the “bedroom conversations” about what really turns them on between the sheets. 

Many women ask me: “But how do I do it without making him feel like he’s underperforming?”

Well, it’s actually more simple than you think. And believe me, men always welcome hearing how to give you more pleasure where it really matters.

The key is to choose your words carefully, which is why I’m about to show you a clear, easy-to-follow script to get your man to please you in exactly the way you want.

Trust me, these are the words he’s dying to hear...

I’ve got something special for you today. It’s an honest, sneaky look “behind the curtain” on some of my biggest secrets of communication and charisma. 

Although my work focuses on relationships, I’ve had more emails than I can count asking: “Can you do a video showing how to be a powerful public speaker/how to tell captivating stories/how to be more charismatic in conversation?”  

This always brings a smile to my face, because to be honest, when I was a teenager, I was the last person anyone would ask to coach them on charisma. 

It took me years of training to even get comfortable on an interview, on the radio, on TV, on stage – yet now, it’s an essential part of my everyday life. 

When I was at school, public speaking was death to me. If I was asked (ok, forced) to speak in front of my classroom, my face would turn bright red and my hands would shake uncontrollably with nerves. 

Luckily, once I exposed myself to enough difficult situations and mastered the essential secrets of influence and powerful communication, I realized that these techniques could be learned by anyone. (Yes, that includes you.)

So, if you’re ready, I’m about open up the treasure chest and give you everything you need to transform into an irresistible magnet of charisma.

Get your pen and paper ready...

I’m a big believer these days in the power of no.

What we decide to say “no” to in relationships is often as important what we say yes to.

And I’ve seen thousands of women saying yes to all the wrong things, like men who say “I’m not sure about us,” for whom they wait months and years in the self-torturing hope he’ll change his mind. 

I even had a woman recently say to me, “He says he’s trying to choose between me and another woman. Should I wait for an answer? Or should I move on?”

Seriously? Wait for an answer? Screw that.

It’s time to say no to being undervalued forever.

One of my favourite quotes says: “If you put a small value on yourself, rest assured the world will not raise your price.”

So if you’re still hanging on that “one guy,” I need, need, need you to watch this. It may just be the biggest wake-up call you’ll ever get...

There are certain dumb myths in dating that women get told over and over:

- Men only care about “one thing.” (Ok, bedroom time is pretty important to us. But it’s obviously not all that men want.)

- Men are less emotional than women. (Yeah, right. If you’ve ever seen a guy fall madly in love for the first time, or recovering from a rough break up, you’ll know this one is BS.)
 
- If  a guy likes you, he’ll make a move and ask you out. (Umm...no. Just no.)
 
In fact, this last one might be the myth I hear most often. 

Well, I can tell you. When I was a shy skinny teenager, there was no way I felt I could just ask out a girl I liked. The risk of being humiliated and rejected was terrifying. 

But…

Smart women realize that any guy who likes them can be led to make the move, so long as she gives him some simple, subtle clues. 

So in the name of helping men and women out everywhere (especially that shy teenage Matt out there ;)), here is my favorite technique for getting any guy to ask you out (even if he’s a little shy at first)...

Do you find yourself always falling for a guy too fast?

You go on a few dates, maybe you end up sleeping with him, and then… you’re totally hooked.

Suddenly, he’s the #1 topic of conversation with you and your friends. 

You find yourself constantly wanting to text him. You sit at home wondering what he’s up to. You’re tempted to rush things forward. 

    Wait. Stop. Relax.

    There’s nothing wrong with being a romantic, but you have to be so careful
here to make the right decisions going forward.

There’s a line from the movie Vanilla Sky that I’ve always loved. It’s when Tom Cruise’s character realizes: “The little things... There’s nothing bigger, is there?” 

 That’s often true in attraction too. 
 
So many people are looking for the huge epiphany, instead of the subtle-yet-powerful changes to their behavior that can skyrocket their results. 

As you’ll see in this video, turning a guy’s head doesn’t have to be complicated. 

Just try some of these simple power moves and you’ll be 500% more sexy.... ;)

There are a few crucial things you can control in life: your actions, your thoughts, how you spend your time, and who you spend it with. 

Ever had that friend who rolls her eyes anytime a guy walks over? Or that coworker who acts super critical about every man you match with on Tinder?

If you feel like you’ve ever been held back by the people in your life, this is the message you need to break free...

There are many secrets to success in love and life – but there's one I've learned that so many people don't realize they have.

It's one that I know has served me my entire life….

I'm allergic to “being ok.”

That seems kind of entitled, doesn't it? Like I can't just be grateful for what I have?

But I'm not talking about entitlement. I'm talking about being prepared to do what it takes to get the maximum possible juice out of your short time on this earth.

That doesn't mean you have to start a billion dollar company, or be a celebrity, or get 10 million followers on Instagram, or any of those other dumb markers that people think equal success.

I mean asking yourself this honest question: Am I living up to a life that is worthy of my potential?

Maybe, like me, you hate the idea of “just getting by,” and just hoping somehow things will magically get better.

In this video, I'll show you a 3-step plan to getting back on an upward path so that you can really have the life and love that you dream of...

So here's the thing: I don't have kids. 

I guess that makes me seem a little underqualified to be giving out parenting advice.

But since it's Mother's Day, I had a super exciting idea: why not share the *best relationship wisdom* from the person who inspired so many of my thoughts about love, empathy, and all the dating advice I would want to give to a child of mine in the future? 

So please welcome: my mom. :)

We're going to break down and share our top 5 secrets that any daughter should know before going into dating and relationships.

My mom is one of my greatest mentors. 

She understands what it is to be a strong, protective parent, but also how to live with an open heart and an attitude of generosity and kindness that overwhelms everyone she meets.

I'm honored to share her wisdom with you...

Why do men keep you stuck in “relationship limbo”?

If you saw last week’s video (which I know a lot of you did) ;), you’ll know that certain guys will never define the relationship.

They’ll dodge the conversation, keep it casual, and generally string you along for as long as possible before bailing when it gets serious.

So how do you turn the tables? 

I have 3 powerful secrets (watch this video to learn what they are...) that will teach you how to stop wasting time with the wrong guys, and finally get commitment from the right ones.

You have no more excuses. It’s time to escape limbo forever and choose the love you deserve...

Ok, I can’t hold this in any longer, so I’m just going to come out with it: This is my new absolute favorite video my team and I have ever released in over a decade of creating content. 

I know you’re going to love it. Especially because it’s about a question so many women are dying to ask men:

*Where is this relationship going?*

Men can be pretty sneaky when it comes to ""defining the relationship."" They say things like...

• “We’re just having fun”

• “I’m so enjoying being with you”

• “Let’s just let it be what it is”

Huh? Can you just answer the question?

Maybe you’ve been trapped here before. In this strange and emotionally confusing place. A place we call “Relationship Limbo.”

If you’ve ever been here before (or know a friend who has), stop whatever you’re doing right this second and watch this...

When you make it “official” with a new guy, at first it feels like you can do no wrong.

He laughs at all your jokes. He smothers you with kisses, tells you never to change, and can’t find anything he doesn’t like about you.

But what about when he stops trying… when his interest fades?

The truth is: When you meet a new guy, your psychology is fighting against you. 

There is a “deadly trap” women fall into when they first fall for a guy – and slowly but surely, it can drain his attraction.

So in this video, I’ll give you the brutally honest truth: Learn it now, take on the high-value behaviour that keeps him hooked, and become much more than just his short-term fling...

Last week you saw why it's so important to make every second count.

But the truth is: It can be really scary to go for the thing your heart most desires.

- You want to talk to that handsome guy at the house party…

- You wish you could do that creative work you're afraid might fail…

- You want to say how you really feel and put your heart on the line in a relationship...

But we are all victims of fear. Fear that costs us precious hours, days, months, years – time we can never recover – and leads us to miss out on love, joy, fun, and emotional fulfillment. 

In this week's video, we’re going to dive deeper and look at the 3 biggest causes of fear, and learn a powerful secret to help you finally take back control...

You might think it’s crazy. 

But I’ve seen it: one moment. One second. One tiny little word that leads to someone finding the love of their life.

And so many women miss that chance every single day.

It’s so simple, so blindingly obvious, but without doing this you can hold yourself back for literally years before you meet your ideal guy.

Are you ready? Good.

Because I don’t want us to waste another second.

So if you’re sick of time slipping away, watch this powerful message to finally take control of your love life. (I promise it’s easier than you think. ;))

Women think going on a date with a guy is simple.

You dress up, groom yourself, and head to an overpriced bar. Then you talk, ask questions, blah blah blah. Gulp down a few drinks. Maybe a kiss. End of story.

Well... that’s not bad.

But do you really want to be just the “not bad” woman in his head?? 

Wouldn’t you rather he go home in a romantic haze, unable to take his mind off this new, unendingly fascinating woman whom he just prays will answer his texts the next day?

Thought so.

If you really want him to miss you after only 24 hours, don’t leave the first encounter without throwing in a few of these man-bait techniques...

“I wish men would be more honest about their feelings...”

“I want a guy who is confident and strong...”

“I want a guy who is giving and generous...”

It’s common to ask for a relationship to satisfy our deepest needs. And you’re right to ask a lot. But it’s not as simple as making a shopping list.

We’re so used to picking from a huge menu: the right career for us, the right sandwich, the right YouTube video...

But relationships are more complicated.

There is a secret though: Smart, successful women are able to act in a way that brings the best out of the guys they date.

How? I’ll show you. Watch this video to learn how to get more from the men in your life. 

I traveled with my mom to Dallas to hear from women about their difficulties with finding Mr. Right, and here you’ll get to enjoy some exclusive behind-the-scenes conversation and on-stage footage with real women. 

Take a peek, learn the next steps…(+ get some super fun bonus footage of my mom trying to get women for me) ;)

Aren’t you sick of it?

You’re depressed after that breakup, or you just got rejected badly, and that friend turns around and tells you, “Hey, be positive. Smile, life is great :)”

And in that second... you hate them.

Screw you, you think, you don’t know what this feels like.

Well, I agree with you. 

Nothing annoys me more than someone who tells you not to feel the pain you’re in. Life can be tough – it lets you down, it feels like being punched in the gut on the bad days.

But the question now is: How do you get out of it?

In this week’s video, I’ll tell you about the most important relationship you’ll ever have, and it may not be the one you think...

I have to be careful here, because I know how so many women are desperate to hear the secrets of how to get a guy back in their lives.

Maybe you feel in so much pain, like you’ll never be happy again without him. Or you’re filled with regret and wish you could rewind and do things differently.

But the truth is, there are many reasons *not* to get your ex back. For example, if he...

(a) Treated you badly

(b) Didn’t care about your needs

(c) Wasn’t able to commit

… chances are this isn’t a man you should pursue any longer.

However.

If you’ve really thought about it, if you feel like you lost a truly great guy, and you aren’t sure what to do next, I need you to see this.

You’ll learn the #1 most important mindset shift you need before you can ever move forward, with or without him...

Are you sick of flaky guys in dating?

You swipe around on Tinder, chat for a while, and then...nothing. It goes nowhere. It fizzles out. Or you message him for two weeks and realize you’ve never actually heard his voice. 

I’m not against dating apps. But I know the frustration that causes so many women to just give up. They decide there are *zero good men* out there and throw in the towel. Or they spend their lives complaining and finding ways to justify their belief that “men just suck.” 

That doesn’t have to be you.

If you want to learn how to win in modern dating, this is the only strategy you’ll need...

I have a very cool, unusual surprise today for you. 

Have you ever wondered what dating will look like 5, 10, 20 years in the future??

Well…

My good friend and highly talented director Ryan Turner has made an incredible, multi-award-nominated short film that shows how you could be dating by 2025.

And after me pestering him for weeks now, he’s kindly allowed us to premiere it on our YouTube channel for the first time.

I’m honored that Ryan has allowed us the privilege of showing this to you. 

It’s touching, honest, a little frightening, and has a truly important message for anyone dating today.

I hope you love it as much as I do...

This is difficult for me to admit.

But the truth is, the average woman who reads dating advice (yep, even mine, sadly) will never make it work. 

Maybe she’ll try a couple of lines on that cute guy at work when she’s had a glass of wine or two, but then she’ll soon retreat back to her default behavior.

That fun, confident, attractive woman she dreams of being will always feel out of her reach.

Why?

Because this kind of woman doesn’t have a system to make herself feel in an attractive mindset when the right guy does come along. 

She might be tired. Overwhelmed. Feeling stressed and lacking in self-esteem. 

She’s just winging it. A little burst of motivation here, a flash of confidence there, but not a truly, effective method for having her confidence grow over time. 

In this video, I’ll show you what really makes you attractive over the long term, and how you can learn this system to bring out your best self whenever you need to when dating...

Question:

What’s the #1 secret to powerful, seductive flirting?

For some women, that’s a silly question. “Flirting is simple,” they’ll say. “It’s just something you do when you like a guy.”

And yet, in my 10 years of learning about attraction, I’ve seen so many women make the same mistakes.

They try to talk to that cute guy at the party, the conversation fizzles out, and they’re left scratching their heads wondering, “Am I being too keen? Too aggressive? Am I just boring?”

But I understand. 

Knowing what men want when it comes to flirting can feel massively confusing. 

In fact, I’ve never seen flirting skills broken down in a useful way – so today I’m going to reveal the ultimate flirting formula. (Trust me, you won’t want to miss this). 

Here’s your new superpower over men...

What is the secret that makes a man look into a woman’s eyes and think, “She is the one for me?”

It isn’t her looks. It isn’t her masters degree in literature. It isn’t the fact that she had the same favorite pizza place in the city (though that helped…). 

No, the reason he fell hard for this woman was because of something no one talks about…

Maybe it’s happened to you before: You knew you kind of liked a guy, but then he did one special move that made your heart do a triple back flip – now you are crazy about him. 

How does this happen??

It’s not about fancy tricks, it’s about understanding this secret of deep, lasting attraction...

You’ve been told the answer is: I have to make him chase…

But there’s a problem with that.

Think of a cat playing with a string. You hold it high up, just out of reach, and the cat leaps in the air, eager to grab it. 

Then you let go. It falls to the floor. Within a second, the cat looks bored, uninterested; it doesn’t care anymore.

This is what happens with men when you play hard to get.

How do you make yourself a challenge that a guy wants to keep chasing, without playing these games? How do you naturally make a man value you for weeks, months, and even years? 

Join me in party capital Miami where I’ll be showing 3 women (and you) the answer...

Joe met Lisa on a trip to the Bahamas. 

He saw her sipping a cocktail and asked her what she was drinking. (It was a Mai Tai.) He ordered a Whisky Sour.

Then it was on to talking all night. They kissed, they danced, and he told her after a few days that he had never met anyone like her.

Now Lisa had a weird feeling: “Uh-oh, I’ve fallen for this guy…” 

She thought about him every day when she got home, remembering that perfect moment on the boat trip when he took her hand and pulled her tight to him.

But then... he never called…(I know, it’s horrible, right?)

The truth is, this often happens because of some very simple mistakes we make when it comes to falling in love.

In this week’s video, I’ll show you how to avoid them...

Within barely 24 hours after swinging open the doors, all 1207 spots on my Impact program sold out. Congratulations to those of you who were able to get a spot! I can’t wait to hear your success stories. 

Ok, onto today’s topic...

No one understands me.

Just kidding. 

But there is something that has been bothering me. A misconception that thousands of people who follow GettheGuy have about my advice, so let me finally clear this up.
Ready? 

You do not need to go on more dates this year to find a great guy. 
Yes, you heard that right. 

Mr. dating-advice-guru-expert-man (or whatever they call me on those TV shows) is telling you to stop with all the drinks-and-dinner dates. They're long, it becomes dull, and it’s a massive waste of your time.

What’s an easier way to meet great men? I’ll show you on this video.

I have some very cool secrets of communication to share with you today.

But first let me ask you a question: What do you really want from 2018?

To finally get back in the dating game and find someone amazing? To execute on that business you’ve been thinking about? To produce excellent work and create  something people love?

I’ve got something a little different for you this week.

This is an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at my seminar in Chicago, where I got all the info from 3 women who revealed exactly how to date in the big city…

Oh, and I also reveal a really simple reason why guys aren’t approaching you, and the simple 4 words that get him to meet you.

P.S. Wherever you are in the world, I wish you the absolute happiest of holidays this December – enjoy, appreciate, and love the people around you and take some time for yourself before we jump into 2018. You’ve earned it :)

I know it’s hard.

I’ve seen all the behaviors that happen when you feel “burnt out” by love:

• Not bothering to meet any new guys (so you don’t get disappointed)
• Being defensive/sarcastic/jokey to cover up your true feelings
• Losing the motivation to go through another relationship again

When love punches us in the gut, it’s easy to become terrified about going for a second round.

But there is a way to fall in love again.

Just use these 5 simple strategies and you’ll be amazed by what happens next...

The first question that we ask is “Why? Why would you do this to me?” 

We look at the possible list of reasons:

► Lust
► Need for sexual validation
► Problems in the relationship

But no matter how hard we try, it’s hard to ever get a clear answer about why people really people cheat. 

How can a man who loves his partner, wants to be with her forever, and thinks she’s the best woman he’s ever met still decide to have a one-night stand with a stranger?

How can a woman who seems to have the perfect husband end up falling into the arms of her co-worker after a few glasses of wine?

I sat down with the incredible Esther Perel, relationship expert and psychotherapist, to get to the real truth about cheating.

Our conversation was mind-blowing, and taught me some huge, powerful insights into relationships that I just had to share with you...

I must have read the same comments 1000 times now.

“Matt, all your advice tells us women we have to do everything, while men get away with being lazy, useless, selfish, etc. How is that fair?”

“I don’t want to keep stroking a man’s ego…”

“Men are dogs. Why should I care so much about pleasing them? Screw this relationship stuff.”

And you know what? Maybe it’s my fault. So I want to clear this up once-and-for-all.

I’ve made this week’s video a very personal message to every woman who follows my advice.

If you’ve ever even vaguely felt that the dating game is rigged unfairly against you, I really need you to hear this...

You know those tricky early dates?

You go for drinks. Maybe a picnic. You pretend you listen to cool music and hope you both enjoy similar taste in movies.

Then texting. 

Then maybe a kiss. (Why not? He’s cute.)

Uh-oh, now you actually like him. Crap. Err, I mean, great. 

Now what? 

If you really want to know how to keep him interested well after the first date, so you can finally stop freaking out whenever you realize you like a guy, this is the video for you...

How do you get a guy to arrange a date without sounding pushy?

Let me set the scene. 

You’re at home on your couch texting back and forth with a guy you met through a friend, while you watch yet another episode of Stranger Things on Netflix. 

He keeps messaging. You text back. He sends another. You text again. He texts again. 

After an hour or two, it starts getting late. Your eyes are heavy as you send the last goodnight text.

As you fall into bed, you think to yourself: “Why doesn’t he just ask me out already?”

Fear not, there is a way. You just need to do 2 things:

(1) Make him feel it’s safe to ask

(2) Inspire him 

In this week’s video, I’m going to show you how to do both with 3 killer texts you can fire off to any guy next time he’s dragging his heels. 

This is the easiest way to get him to arrange a date (while still being high value in his eyes…)

Pull up a seat. It’s time we had an honest talk about men.

When looking for love, I believe there’s no better way to start than by deeply understanding what drives the opposite sex. 

It teaches you not only the psychology of attraction, but also, how to avoid the wrong people who are driven by their worst instincts and toxic behavior. 

So in this week’s video, I sat down for a juicy conversation with my good friend Lewis Howes (host of the School Of Greatness podcast) to discuss the truth about masculinity, why certain men become “eternal bachelors”, and what this means for you as a woman in the dating scene.

If you want to know how to spot which guys to date when it comes to finding commitment, you need to see this…

Did you know a little bit of creativity goes a looong way in flirting?

When a guy sees you do something unexpected (but alluring), it makes him see you in a totally new way.

Unfortunately, most people just settle for the odd compliment and a suggestive phrase here and there, but there are so many more ways to get him hooked if you know how. 

So since Halloween is nearly here, I thought I’d share some of my favourite flirting techniques you can use to have him holding you close this October. 

Put your fears to bed, and watch…

Did you know there are 3 types of women who struggle to ever reach the romantic life of their dreams? 

If you find yourself as one of these types, you can end up feeling lonely, confused, tired, and repeatedly stuck in love.

And until we really dig deep to understand the psychological reasons we repeat the same behaviors when looking for love, things will always stay the same.

So today...we’re going to dig deep. 

To put it simply, this is probably one of my most important videos of the entire year.

And as a special treat, I’m going to give you a huge bonus at the end revealing the #1 inner secret that will change your relationships forever.

Do you know what really makes relationships fall apart?

I do. 

Having now coached for over 10 years on the topic of dating, I’ve seen the worst behaviors over and over again. 

And if we don’t work on eliminating these toxic relationship habits, it doesn’t matter how attractive we are: we’ll always find a way to self-sabotage and drive our partner away.

I don’t know about you, but a lifetime of painful arguments and emotional mind games isn’t something I ever want to settle for in love.

So here are 6 relationship-killing behaviors to avoid at all costs if you want to keep an amazing guy...

“Guys always freak out after a few dates with me. My friends say it’s because I’m intimidating…”

“Men just want a submissive girlfriend. They feel threatened by a woman who is too independent and successful…”

During my latest whirlwind of media appearances and interviews in New York City, I decided to get my cameraman and all-round creative genius Jameson to shoot some exclusive behind-the-scenes footage of all the juiciest dating tips I talked about.

You’ll get to see a ton of important conversations about some of the biggest issues for women in dating right now (at least as I see it). 

Along the way, I reveal what you should do when faced with a cheater in relationships, talk about the secret to dating successfully past 40, and even show you a powerful, sneaky communication trick my Mum used to influence my Dad on a car trip (and you can use it too) ;)

Hope you enjoy this peek behind the curtain…

Let’s get real. Your dating life won’t change by sending a single text.

So many women who follow my advice will tell me:

“Matt, I sent him that message you recommended, and it worked. He started running back to me. :) But then a week later he went cold again and now I don’t know what to do…help”.

I’ve heard this so many times that I need to say something about it.

In this week’s video, I’ll explain why it’s so easy to fall into this trap, and show you what you need to make a powerful, lasting transformation in your relationships forever...

Last week I showed you how to respond to a flakey guy using my killer “Bliss Point” texts - which combines being salty and sweet to make a guy totally addicted to you.

Except…

Some of the more angry responses said things like:

“Matt, why would I even think about being sweet to a guy who flakes on a date?? He should be chasing me already, and if not, I have a right to be angry when I text back…”

To tell you the truth, I’m really glad these comments came up (and I kind of expected it). 

In this week’s video, I’m about to show you why this response relates to a huge mistake 99% of people make in dating.

Make sure you don’t fall into this common trap...

This might be the #1 most powerful communication secret for getting a guy hooked on you that I’ve ever seen...

See, most women are used to being told things like:

“You need to make him work for it”

“You need to have standards”

“You need to respect yourself”

But how do you actually do it?

For example, if he sends you a flakey text on the night of a date, how should you respond to get him chasing again (whilst showing you have self-respect)?

In this week’s video, I’m going to give you 3 killer texts that show your standards, put you back in control, and double his attraction for you. 

Like I said, this secret is hugely powerful. 

Use it wisely...

I’m still totally stunned by your amazing reactions to last week’s video on loneliness. 

When I last checked, the video had more than 1,000 YouTube comments, many of which were heartfelt confessions from people who had been in the same boat.

It’s crazy how many of us suffer in silence, when we all go through the same painful struggles. 

And after reading these emotional responses, I realised a huge truth about getting rid of loneliness that I didn’t mention in last week’s video.

Learn this simple-yet-powerful concept, and you’ll have an essential tool to create happy, meaningful relationships and feel connected again...

I know what it’s like.

You walk out of work, realize you don’t have plans this evening, and make your way home through the evening traffic.

Turning the lights on, you throw your bag on the table and start to make dinner.

You scroll through your phone, looking at other people’s lives on Instagram, wondering why every day feels the same while everyone else is out on crazy, exciting adventures with the people they love.

This is the epidemic of the 21st century: loneliness.

I’ve felt it too.

But I’ve realized over the years that there are ways to break free of this and feel empowered and connected again.

If you’re not sure where to turn right now, make sure you watch this message...

How can you lose a guy in 10 seconds?

It’s easy. 

I’ve seen so many women with amazing qualities: kindness, empathy, humor, intellectual curiosity, passion…

...and yet they suffer from a few negative social habits that push guys away in the very first conversation. 

See, no matter how attractive you are, there are certain “mood-killing turnoffs” that guys instantly notice and run away from.

Eliminate these 4 big flirting mistakes and watch his attraction for you skyrocket...

For a long time I thought it was crazy how many women asked me to talk about this topic. 

But now, I realize the reason is obvious: In 2017, more of us are doing long-distance relationships than ever. 

You meet a great guy on Instagram who doesn’t live in the same country...

You start dating the perfect man in your city, only to find out he’s been offered a new job 1000 miles away…

And suddenly, you find yourself having “Skype dates”, and you now spend half your work day sending silly photos to each other on Whatsapp. 

You feel like you’re falling in love with this guy – but can it actually work long term?? 

Should you follow your heart and go for it, or should you listen to your head and call it quits? What’s the answer? 


These are big questions, so I decided this it was time to be super honest about long-distance and my thoughts on it.

Here’s what you really need to know...

It’s so annoying. 

You finally decide you like a guy. You tell your friends how excited you are. You even allow yourself to imagine him as “future husband” material. 

And then suddenly...he starts fading out.

He stops calling…

He becomes colder in conversation…

He doesn’t step up and commit…

It’s like the universe knows when you’ve met an amazing guy, and decides to dangle him just out of reach. 

Whyyyyy? 

In this week’s video, I reveal the top 5 reasons men disappear so you never have to wonder why he pulls away again...

It’s no secret that men are visual creatures.

Although appearance isn’t the only thing that matters in long-term attraction, the first spark always begins with what he sees.

Luckily, this week I’m joined by my good friend and super-talented fashion expert Louise Roe, who is going to give you 3 killer outfits that get a guy attracted in any situation – how cool is that?

I’m always being asked about the secrets I used to build my company Get The Guy into what it is today. 
 
When I started, I had no income, slept on an office floor in London, and worked out of my apartment filming YouTube videos with one employee and my brother Stephen.
 
Two years later I had an offer for a TV show on NBC with Eva Longoria, a six-figure business that was growing rapidly, and was being written about in newspapers as “The Real Life Hitch,” “The Dating Guru,” and all kinds of other embarrassing titles I would rather forget.
 
People always say, “What is the secret, Matt? Did you just get lucky?”
 
Well, yes, I have been lucky in my life. 
 
But I also had a huge advantage that I’ve used repeatedly over the last 10 years to explode my success in ways that most other people don’t get to experience in a lifetime.
 
And today, I’m going to reveal it to you.
 
Once you learn how to use this “secret sauce” for yourself, you can get practically anything you want…

Is dating really that terrible in 2017? 
 
It’s easy to believe the doomsayers. Especially if you read enough blogs and think-pieces with titles like:
 
“The Dating Apocalypse Is Here”
 
“The Worst Time To Date Ever?”
 
“Why Men Today Suck So Much…”
 
Etc. Etc. Etc.
 
Well, I don’t buy it. 
 
Yes, the dating world has changed for both men and women. 
 
But there’s a huge advantage to be gained for women who understand the secrets to creating real attraction today (while everyone else is swiping on Tinder).
 
Get ready to take back control and transform your dating life...

You wouldn’t believe how many women read every blog, watch every YouTube video, and follow every Facebook post I put out, and yet still say:

“Yeah, Matt… I get it. But there’s this one guy that I really like…”

And because they’re so head-over-heels for this man, all of the advice goes out of the window.

In this week’s video, I’m about to reveal 2 simple words that will tell you everything you need to know about men and how to get the love you really deserve…

It’s true. Some modern men suck. 
 
And yet... 
 
I read a comment from a woman on my latest YouTube sketch with Anna Akana which said: “This makes me never want to date again.”
 
When I saw that, I sighed in disappointment. 
 
I get it. 
 
It’s easy to decide that the opposite sex is hopeless. 
 
It’s easy to say, “guys never want commitment”, or “all modern men are players”. (Believe me, I hear plenty of male friends with their own complaints about modern women). 
 
But if you’re tired of these stereotypes and want to learn the behavior that attracts the truly great guys out there, make sure you watch this week’s video. 
 
You’ll learn how the most attractive women use their knowledge of men to their advantage...

Ever had a guy say one of these phrases and wondered what it meant?

“You’re kind of intimidating...”

“How come you’re single?”

“I’m just having fun in my dating life right now…”

Well, you’re in luck.

I teamed up with the hilarious Anna Akana this week to bring you a sketch that will translate male language so that you know exactly what’s in a man’s mind...

Enjoy ;)

I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked to talk about dating as a single parent by my audience. 

And you know how much I can’t bear to let you down, right? ;)

Let’s be real: Dating a guy when you have kids can be scary. 

When should you talk about it? What if they don’t like him? Can you make time for romance in your (already) crazy schedule?

I reached out to all the single moms on my Fast Track members list and invited a few to my house in LA to break down exactly what it’s like being a single dating mom in 2017. 

If you want to see some raw, honest, enlightening advice on this huge topic, watch this video. 

Get ready for some real talk...

How’s this for scary? 

I’m in the studio on The Today Show opposite Kathy Lee and Hoda. It’s not my everyday situation, and I’m trying to make sure I’m on my best game.

“So, what should a woman do here, Matthew?”

“Well, point number one is (blah blah blah).” I rattle it off with ease because I have it locked ready to go in my mind. “...And secondly…um...”

They look at me expectantly. Along with the millions of viewers I suddenly realize are watching across the USA.

“Secondly...make sure that….uh...”

My mind freezes. I go blank and panic inside. I can’t remember what I was going to say.

If you want to see my full torture and how this played out... watch this video. 

You’ll learn the most important reason why we freeze and get stuck in dating, and I’ll reveal the ridiculously simple mental shift to blast away fear in those moments...

I can’t believe how many women still write this on their Tinder profiles.

Every guy I’ve asked knows what I’m talking about. 

This toxic phrase scares off a huge amount of men, yet it feels like at least 25% of women seem to do it.

I’ll show you a simple shift that gets a guy to chase you, instead of pushing him away...

Question: Have you ever wondered what to say to a guy who isn’t showing you enough interest? 

Let’s face it: We live in a flaky dating culture. People don’t text back. They cancel plans on the day. Or maybe they just don’t try hard enough in the early stages.

So…

How should you respond when this happens? 

Many people make a huge mistake in their reply, which you’ll see from a real woman’s comment I discuss in this week’s video. 

So that you don’t fall into that trap, I’ll show you a powerful response that will get you 5x more attention from the right guys...

I was surprised to scroll through the comments of my last video and find the following complaints:

“Modern men are such cowards” 

“A real man should go after what he wants...”

“This is beta male behavior…”

Hmm…

I have some strong opinions on this.

Let’s face it: it’s tough for guys to approach women. 

And this week, you’ll learn exactly why it’s so dangerous to hold it against guys who just need a bit of encouragement...

It’s funny how often women tell me they don’t know when a guy is flirting.
 
Because to us men, we think we’re being so obvious. 
 
What seems to women like normal male behavior at a party, a bar, or a coffee shop, is often our attempt to desperately get your attention.
 
So, if you’re still confused about whether he’s interested, make sure you learn these 7 sneaky signs…

“I’m too old…”

“I haven’t dated in 10 years…”

“I’m divorced and don’t know how to be single again…”

But it’s so important you break through these worries and get back in the game. 

This week, I’m going to share an inspirational story that proves the truly attractive mindset that will make you magnetic again in dating.

Let’s face it, I have a weird job. 

My friends think so. My mum definitely thinks so.

You’ll see some of my personal thoughts on the state of modern dating, as well as one of my most powerful mindset shifts to help you handle your emotional response when a guy flakes on you...

He’s less available for dates... check.

A feeling of “distance” in the way he speaks... check.

How do you know if a man is the perfect guy for you?

Many women assume that he has to tick a bunch of traits on a checklist (e.g. he’s not too short or tall, has the right career, loves animals, plays sports, has his own hair, etc. etc.)

But these are just preferences. They aren’t what really matters when it comes to love. 

I don’t know about perfect, but I’ve learnt that choosing an amazing partner comes down to just five big questions. 

Make sure you can answer all of these 100% before you decide on him...

It’s so easy to ignore all the warning signs from men.

You like him. He has a good career. You have amazing sexual chemistry. But there are things that you know make him wrong for a relationship:

His wandering eye…

His emotional withdrawal…

His selfish, narcissistic behavior…

If you’ve ever been tempted to stay with a guy despite everything your gut tells you, please watch this video now, before you do anything else today.

I’m about to save you years of heartache and emotional pain...

50 Shades of Grey is a weird story.

Christian is a hot, emotionally-damaged billionaire with some crazy ex girlfriends and a craving for sadomasochism. 

Ana is the young, bookish wallflower with whom he becomes totally obsessed. 

Before they date, he even makes her sign a contract to state which kinky activities he’s allowed to perform on her in the bedroom.

Umm... can anyone say major red flags?? 

So I was thinking: What if someone was 100% honest about this relationship? 

I really don’t want to spoil this week’s video, but all I’ll say is, this is how the trailer should have gone... ;)

What’s the #1 sexiest thing a woman can do on a first date?

Play footsie under the table? Wear a low-cut V-neck sweater? Whisper, “Hey handsome” in his ear when he gives you a hug?

Nope. 

While those things won’t by any means hurt your chances, what really makes a guy want you depends on how you make him feel in your company. 

He needs to feel intrigued. He needs to feel attractive. He needs to feel a sense of fun…

This week, I’m going to teach you 5 killer lines you can say to any guy to fill him with great emotions and get him dying to see you again...

So you slept with a guy.

It was good. But now you wake up and have that awkward moment... what now? And how do you keep him attracted afterwards? 

People tend to get a little awkward in dating after “getting physical” for the first time. 

I get it. You want to play it cool, but you also make sure this guy knows you’re interested.

So here are 3 killer techniques that will make him desperate to see you again...

Uh-oh, you like a guy. 

Quick, whatever you do, don’t let him know. Or else he’ll think you’re desperate.

What rubbish. 

From a young age, women are taught “be passive, let him come to you, and for the love of all things holy don’t scare him away by showing you’re interested.”

If you want to know the truth about what really makes the difference between keeping a guy interested or scaring him away, you need to watch this...

Here’s to women taking back control ;)

P.S. I’ve put together an incredible free gift for you at the end of this video, so please make sure you watch all the way to the end so you don’t miss out.

Here’s a question – how do you know when you’re ready to commit to a relationship?

It’s easy to for us to stereotype and say that men are the only ones who struggle with this problem, but women do, too.

Since moving from London to the United States, it’s taken a while for me to get used to the idea of Thanksgiving. 

At first it felt weird to have an extra holiday squeezed in just before Christmas. 

But now I love it (watch this video to see what I’m thankful for). 

And it got me wondering... could you even be grateful for the bad things in life? Say, bad dates, bad men, bad relationships?

Sound crazy?

Well, take a look at this and you’ll see what I mean...

I’ve met many women on my programs who are scared because life is changing around them. 

Relationships come and go. Children grow up. People get fired. Love is lost and found. It’s all difficult. 

When life changes around us, our instinct will always be to think things like:

“This is scary”
“I don’t know what’s going to happen to me”
“How will I cope with this?”

But what if you could make change work for you? What if you didn’t have to feel afraid and helpless anymore?

In this video, I’m going to share my biggest 2 secrets about long-term change and show how you can be 5x more prepared and excited for this new chapter in your life...

I decided to have some fun this week and read out your (often hilarious) responses to last week’s video on the “MPI Guy.”

But hearing so many passionate responses made me wonder: Why do so many women waste so much time with terrible guys like this, especially when he puts in such a poor level of effort?

Well, I’ll show you.

It really hurts me to say this, because I know that there are so many wonderful men in the world. 

But there’s one type of guy that is so common – so toxic and frustrating – that just about every woman has had to deal with at least once in her life: The “MPI” Guy. 

What is an “MPI” Guy? 

Well... there’s about a 99% chance you already know one. 

See if you recognize him in this video...

I’m about to let you in on a secret about men, but I should warn you: Most women don’t believe me when I say this.

Here goes...

Men notice a lot more than you think.

I know. It sounds crazy. Men are always painted as dumb gorillas who don’t care about anything except for taking a woman’s clothes off and eating sandwiches. 

Now, although that may be enough to get him hooked for a night (OK, maybe a week), what gets him to commit is actually much more subtle.

In this week’s video, I’ll reveal an untold secret about what makes men see you as “girlfriend material,” and show you exactly how to make him desire you more than any woman he’s dated with a few simple tweaks in your behavior.

You wouldn’t believe how often people  ask: “What kind of woman would Matthew Hussey date?”

Well... there’s a long answer and a short answer.

The short answer is silly, but it’s one of my MOST ESSENTIAL NEEDS in a relationship.

In fact, you’ll probably think it sounds dumb if I say it out loud. (What do men REALLY want? I’ll tell you in this short clip…)

Ok, ready? 

I need a girlfriend who loves to cuddle. 

Yep. I’m a cuddler.

Maybe my mum was too doting on me as a child. Maybe I love physical attention. Maybe I just like the smell of women’s perfume when my face is buried in her hair. 

That’s just me though. Not every man is as big on cuddles as I am. 

However, there are certain qualities in a woman that ALL men are attracted to. And that’s what I want to talk about in this week’s video. 

I’m going to reveal what the top 4 irresistible traits in a woman are so that you know exactly how to get any guy addicted (regardless of his views on cuddling)...

This really bothers me, so maybe you can help…

Why do so many women allow guys to get away with treating them so carelessly??

Women often ask me, “Matt, you give all this great advice for women to be high-value, but how do I tell if HE’S an incredible man worthy of a relationship with ME?”

Ok, I’ll bite. 

80% of a happy relationship is choosing the right person in the first place, so this issue couldn’t be more important for women who want to find lasting love.

In this week’s video, I join forces with my brother Stephen Hussey (co-author of Get The Guy) to talk about the 6 SURE SIGNS you’re dating a high value guy, so that you can spot when he’s truly someone worth investing in.

Ever heard these words out of a guy’s mouth, “It’s not you, it’s your friend""?
 
Probably not.

The reason? We guys won’t tell you the truth, but your friends can drive us away in the first 30 seconds without you even realizing it.

Maybe your best friend always gives men an icy cold stare when they approach you at the bar. Or she constantly throws little “playful” insults at him when he’s trying to flirt with you. Or she drags you away just when the conversation is going great.
 
If this is you, it’s time to STOP LETTING YOUR FRIENDS SCREW UP YOUR LOVE LIFE!
 
And if YOU happen to be that friend… watch this video and get your game together.
 
Why? 

Because being an awesome wingwoman can help you and your best friend meet 10x more amazing guys when you go out. 

But you have to be a team and become one another’s secret weapon...

P.S. If you already have an amazing wingwoman, please SHARE this video with her :)

{ABOUT THIS VIDEO}

“I think we need to break up.”

Those are the 7 most heartbreaking words you never want to hear him say in a relationship. 

When you feel like you’d do anything to keep this guy in your life, those words can tear your entire world apart.

You text your friends, “What did I do WRONG?!”

You tell your family, “I don’t know if I’m EVER going to feel ok again…”

You can’t eat. You can’t enjoy movies anymore. You crawl into your bed and hope to yourself that this is just a bad dream you’ll wake up from in the morning.

I know this isn’t easy... believe me... I’ve been there (more than once!).

If you want to recover from this breakup and come back stronger and better than ever, watch this 3-minute video and TAKE CONTROL of your life again. 

What’s more, if you follow these exact steps, there’s a chance you may just even be able to save your relationship...

{ABOUT THIS VIDEO}

I never talk about this, so don’t get mad at me for mentioning it. 

But in this week’s video, I’ve decided it’s time to have an honest conversation about one of the most controversial topics in dating. 

I’m talking, of course, about a woman’s biological clock.

Maybe you’ve recently hit your early 30s and are starting to think about a family. Or you’re approaching your late 30s and wondering when it’s going to happen. Maybe you’re 40 and are thinking you’ve been ready for a long time to settle down and have children. 

If any of these is you, I need you to watch this. It’s really, REALLY important. I don’t want you or a guy you’re dating to make a mistake that you both regret later down the road.

This is one of the most important videos I’ve ever made for BOTH men and women, one that I hope you’ll truly take on board if you’re currently dating a guy and aren’t sure where things are going in your relationship. 

Please share this message with anyone you think needs to hear it...

{ABOUT THIS VIDEO}

Ever wondered why “holiday romances” happen so often?
 
It’s because when people take a break from their normal environment, they take MORE social risks than usual.
 
Think about it: You’re at that summer party. On the beach. Or maybe you’re 1000 miles away from home in another country.
 
You start conversations, find yourself with 5 new friends in a week, maybe meet a cute guy, and you wonder to yourself, “Why can’t I be like this all the time?!” 
 
It’s weird how just taking a break can put us in an entirely different mindset.
 
When people travel, even the most introverted of wallflowers can find themselves able to walk into a room and effortlessly strike up a conversation with anyone!
 
Why?
 
Because they adopt “The Holiday Mindset.”
 
In this week’s video, I logically break down exactly why it’s so much easier to meet guys when you take on this psychology and give my 3 simple techniques for getting out of your shell and employing this mindset in your everyday life (especially if you want to meet an amazing guy this summer).
 
Here’s to having fun in the sun! ;)

{ABOUT THIS VIDEO}

Ever noticed how whenever you try to break out of your comfort zone, there’s always someone who wants to criticize and tear you down? 

There’s a basic fact I’ve come to realize about the world, and it’s a tough one, but it’s 100% true: Most people aren’t comfortable with seeing you make the changes necessary to achieve your dreams.

Sounds harsh, I know. 

But the more you break out of your shell in life, the more people will be threatened by seeing you reach your true potential.

Why? 

Because it robs them of their OWN excuses.

You can work and expand your comfort zone and try many things, but the world will always want to put you in a tiny box. People will try to shape you into an image that THEY find comfortable for THEM.

In this week’s video, I’m going to show you that you can FIGHT BACK and choose your own identity once and for all, without having to stress about other people’s opinions.

I want you to defy expectations, to rise up and do everything you’re capable of, to shape your destiny according to what YOU want, rather than according to what makes everyone else feel safe.

{ABOUT THIS VIDEO}

“Matt, is it true that men just aren’t attracted to smart women?”

Hmm... well...

It’s often believed that there is an unfair bias against those women with high IQs in dating. Women are attracted to smart men, they say, but guys feel threatened by women who challenge them too much in the brains department.

But is that stereotype actually true??

In this week’s blog video, I’m going to reveal the 100% honest answer based on my research on men and attraction. If you’re a smart person and have ever felt compelled to hide your knowledge from guys in conversation, then you REALLY need to hear this advice...

{ABOUT THIS VIDEO}
Why do guys overlook some women and give ALL the attention to others?

If you’re like most women, you probably think that it all comes down to physical beauty. Of course, our looks are always a factor in attraction, but that’s actually just one part of what gets him intrigued by you.

Most of us miss amazing opportunities every day: at a bar, at our friend’s birthday, at that barbecue where we could meet so many great new people if only we made 10% more effort. 

Let’s face it: Saying even “hi” to a new guy can be nerve-wracking, even at an event with people you already know!

In this week’s blog video, I’m going to show you the 5 PRACTICAL tips for getting a guy’s attention at a social gathering so that you can stand out from the crowd and feel TOTALLY CONFIDENT while doing it.

About this video

If you’ve ever wondered, “does he like me,”  “how to get a guy to like you,” or “does he love me,” then you don’t want to miss this video…

“I know a guy who acts really charming and friendly, but I have no idea if he actually LIKES me!”

It’s annoying, right?

Especially if the guy is a naturally charismatic guy anyway. How do you know if he has eyes for you, or if he’s just like that with every woman he meets? 

Taking the risk of putting yourself on the line for this guy could mean embarrassment, rejection, or make things super-awkward between you both later on.

You need to know when you have the green light. You need to be sure when it’s ok to flirt and test the waters.

In this week’s blog video then, I’m going to show you the 7 obvious signs a guy REALLY likes you. It’s easy to miss these classic behaviors that show his interest, but trust me: guys are much more predictable than you would think...

About this video

I’ve had many critics over the years.

When I first started coaching at 18 years old, people had a LOT to say about why a kid like me thought he could tell people anything about dating.. 

Everyone told me that giving advice to women wouldn’t work.

People I knew at university laughed at the idea of me speaking on stage and talking about confidence.

Friends said I was crazy to put videos of myself up on YouTube and subject myself to the lion’s den of public opinion.

Well, over TEN years on and after reaching millions of people around the world, people STILL throw out their criticisms.

I had a viral video hit this week (over 16 million views in three days!), and sure enough, many of my new followers said: “Who the hell is this Matthew Hussey and why should I listen to what this young guy has to say??”

Comments like that used to worry me. These days, I smile and say: “Ah, this again”.

In this week’s video, I want to have a serious conversation. I don’t know why you’re holding back right now. I don’t know what dream you’re putting off or what creative idea you’re still scared to try in case it fails. 

But if you’re STILL living in fear of the opinions of others, this is the video is for you...

About this video

“OMG I went on a date with the most amazing guy!”

Your girlfriends get excited. He’s handsome, he's tall, he has a master’s degree, and he runs his own successful company.

Could this be any better?

But wait! Are you moving too quickly? That’s always the risk that worries so many women I speak to.

When we realize we REALLY like someone, it can be the scariest and most dangerous moment in our relationship. We rush ahead of ourselves. We commit our time, our emotions, our energy – and that’s before we know if it’s really going somewhere! 

In this video , I’m going to give you the 100% TRUTH about why so many women jump the gun in the early dating stage and give you two important secrets that you must remember if you truly want a guy to commit.

About this video

“Eww... look at that stomach."" 

“I hate my chubby legs.”

“I wish I had better skin.”

This is how we talk to ourselves every single day. 

We wake up, go to the mirror, and immediately think about everything that’s wrong with our body. 

We go the gym, read magazines, watch TV, and feel completely inferior compared to the perfect, toned, athletic figures put in front of our eyes 24/7.

How much happiness are you losing because of your body image? How is this affecting your day-to-day confidence? I find it terrifying how mean we are to ourselves in this area. I’m all for self-improvement, but not at the cost of self-love.

In this week’s blog video, I share a story about my own moment of body insecurity and give you 2 ways to INSTANTLY improve your body image so that you can walk through the world with confidence again. 

Remember: Just because you have goals to achieve, doesn’t mean you can’t be kind to yourself along the way.

About this video

You’re on a first date with a guy. 

You just finished your drinks and the waiter hands you the check.

He’s about to pay. Should you offer to cover your half of the bill? Or just smile and say thank you when the guy puts his credit card on the table? 

First date manners matter A LOT. You’d be shocked how many times I’ve heard from guys who were so turned off by a woman’s attitude towards money that they instantly disregarded her as “girlfriend material” because of it. 

I’m not going to lie, in this week’s blog video, I get PRETTY controversial.

But I think this REALLY matters, so I hope you’ll keep an open mind when you watch this. You’ll get a glimpse into my live seminar where I explain exactly how to approach the question of who pays on a first date in a way that makes him MORE attracted to you.

If I had to guess, over 7928753 women have now asked me what to do when a guy ghosts you.

Wait...You haven’t heard of ghosting?

Ghosting is when a guy you’ve been dating suddenly disappears: no messages, no phone calls, no tearful goodbye – just gone forever, never to be seen or heard from again. 

Sounds brutal? It is.

I’ve heard many harrowing stories from recovering “Ghostees” and trust me, it’s not a pretty sight.

Questions I hear all the time from these women include:

– What is wrong with men?
– How do I get closure?
– Are all guys secretly psychopaths? 
– Seriously, what is WRONG with men??

In this week’s blog video, for the first time, I’m going to tell you my essential rules for responding to a guy if and WHEN you get ghosted (though here’s hoping you never do). 

It’s not an easy situation, and this might not be the easiest advice to take, but trust me, it’s something you need to hear.

Ever find when you meet a REALLY cute guy it’s impossible to flirt and just be yourself?

It’s a common scenario: You see that guy you like from across the room.

Your eyes meet his and he smiles (god, he looks adorable when he does that). Ok, he’s walking over to your group, it’s showtime… what do you SAY to him?!

Flirting with guys is tricky if you don’t know the right techniques. Sure, there are women out there who naturally “get it” and have some inherent skill at getting a guy’s attention.

But guess what? 

Once you know the secret you’ll see how ANY woman can get men to notice her.

In this week’s video, I want to share the biggest flirting mistake women make when they meet a guy they really like. Then I’m going to show you in 3 minutes how you can turn that guy you like from a friend into something more with just a few magic words.

I wouldn’t be anywhere near the person I am today without my mum (and you’ll hear why in this week’s video...)

When it came time to decide who I wanted to dedicate my book to when it was first published, I didn’t have any hesitation about who I wanted to thank more than anyone else in the world.

Which is why the first page reads, “To the most high-value woman I know, my mum.""

Mother’s Day is a day we can all unite on. Whatever stage of life we’re in, all of us have a mother to thank for keeping us safe before we were ever born and for bringing us into this world. 

It’s easy to forget the sacrifices someone made just for us to be here now, able to live, think, work, and enjoy the relationships around us.

But as I see it, today isn’t only about mothers. 

In fact, I have a special message for ALL WOMEN, and if you have 3 minutes to spare today, I’d love for you to take a look and let me know what you think...

“Hey, I’m sorry but I don’t see things working out between us…”

Ever received that text after a few dates? I know I have. It makes you want to scream: WHY? WHAT DID I DO? JUST GIVE ME ANSWERS! 

You feel confused. Confused and annoyed. In all honesty though, you just feel hurt that things didn’t work out as you’d hoped.

But you’re in luck... because in this week’s video my brother Steve tells a story about how he figured out the #1 classy text message you can send to ANYONE when you get this rejection.

It’s simple and genius, and it’s shows such confidence that it actually led Steve to an interesting future opportunity...

You woke up this morning. You hit snooze. You went back to sleep.

Oh crap! Now you’re finally out of bed and it’s already way past the hour when you said you’d go for that morning run!

And now, because you missed your wake-up call, you’re also going to be behind on all that extra work you mean to get finished today.

ARGGHH!

Great. The perfect morning you planned is ruined already. Better just coast through work today, skip the gym, forget seeing your friends tonight, sit and eat ice cream, maybe try again tomorrow, right?

Wait. Stop. Breathe.

If you’ve EVER had this panic before, this could be the most important 4 minutes of your life.

In this week’s video, I share a concept that’s saved me hundreds of wasted hours and completely changed my life once I began using it.

The agony of a breakup is awful. I wouldn’t wish that pain on my worst enemies.
 
But sometimes pain is good.
 
It forces us to take pause. It forces us to re-evaluate. Like any great loss, it can actually help us put our lives in perspective and make it clear where to focus our energy next.
 
What about getting your ex back though? Is it possible?

Well…yes, it is…but let me warn you: it’s not for everyone.

For some couples though, getting back together after some time apart can be an incredible boost to creating a new, better relationship than before.

Maybe that’s you.

If so, in this video I’m going to show you the very first step to getting your ex back. If you don’t know where to turn next, I’ll show you EXACTLY what to say to win him back into your life.

So...I realised I’m scared of dying.

Not exactly shocking news, but I had one of those moments in this week’s video, climbing up the steps of the Peñon de Guatapé in Colombia when I thought “PLEASE JUST LET ME SURVIVE THIS!”

On your way up the mountain, everything is scary. 

We might fall and come crashing down to where we started. Or the journey upwards will be arduous and painful, and we never quite know for sure whether we’re going to ever reach our destination.

We all have our summits to reach in life… in our health, relationships, career. Getting to that target weight, writing that book we keep talking about, meeting that person and being fulfilled in our personal life – it can all seem scary to begin, especially when we worry about getting stuck in the middle and wondering what to do next.

So this video is my KICK UP THE BUTT...not just as a reminder to you, but to me.

One step at a time...

I can’t tell you how many women have asked me the same question: “Why do I only seem to EVER meet guys that are completely the wrong age for me?”

Or to put it more simply (as one client asked me): “Where are all the great, single, 40-year old men hiding??” 

Like it or not, we all know that age is a factor in dating. But so many people waste years moaning about where they are in life (I’m too old, I’m too young…) instead of doing something about it.

Often it’s not about age at all. We use that as our crutch, when really, if we’re truly honest with ourselves, maybe we just aren’t being pro-active enough right now and investing in the CRUCIAL STRATEGIES that would bring us closer to finding love.

So in this week’s video, I’m going to share some down-to-earth, PRACTICAL tips for finding a guy no matter what age you are

You see a guy you’re attracted to, but you can’t bring yourself to talk to him.

Why?

The usual reasons. What if it doesn’t go well? What if people laugh? What if he is totally out of my league?

Deep down though, there is another truth you’re scared to face: Maybe you’re not really loveable. (Btw - if that’s you, take 5 minutes to watch this and learn how to shake off this BS belief forever!)

Think about it: What if it actually DOES go well with this guy, then he wants to get closer, and then he sees the REAL YOU, and then...well...maybe he won’t be crazy about the person you are inside.

Many of us have had those thoughts: “they won’t like me”, “I’m not good enough for that crowd”, “I don’t deserve to be here”. If you can relate to these feelings even 1%, you need to see this week’s video.

It’s a personal message from me to you, because I’ve seen up close how these feelings of inferiority can cost us YEARS of our lives if we don’t stand up to them while we have the chance.

Within just one day of swinging open the doors, all 755 spots on my Impact program sold out.

Congratulations to those of you who were able to get a spot! I can’t wait to hear your success stories.

Ok, onto today’s topic.

This week I invited all of you to send me your questions (and was surprised and delighted by the kind of issues that came up!)

Here are some of the meaty topics we ended up covering:

– Why do guys in relationships still indulge in sexual fantasy?

– Is it ok to feel resentful when you only get attention from guys after losing weight?

– How do you know if a guy is cheating?

And if all that isn’t enough, I’m joined by my incredibly handsome brother Stephen, who once again returns to my channel by popular demand. 

I know you’ll enjoy this one!

Relationships are hard.
 
Two people can want to be together but have TOTALLY different criteria for the amount time spent together, the amount of affection and hugging they want, and the amount of sex they should have.
 
So what if this new guy you're dating is amazing…but you don’t feel compatible in your expectations?
 
In this week’s LOVELife, I speak with a caller who worries if she is TOO independent for her guy, and how she can be honest with him about her need for space without hurting his feelings.

As a teenager, I was obsessed with learning about people.

It was my #1 hobby. 

I would see charismatic people in interviews on TV: movie stars, public speakers, fascinating storytellers, and I would wonder, “What is their secret?”

Luckily, my Dad was an enormous self-improver. 

He had a ton of books on communication, negotiation, influence, and thanks to him I learnt so many secrets of impact that I still use every single day in my seminars, in my YouTube videos, in my business negotiations…

When you learn that importance of having influence and impact on people, you realise that it NEVER stops being important.

So in this week’s video, I want to open up the kimono and share some of these secrets by showing THREE simple ways you can immediately make someone drawn to you in conversation.

What happens when we get “tunnel vision” about one guy?
 
It can lead to us relaxing our standards, being too available, or giving a guy all your time and affection before he has EARNT his place in your life.
 
Many women have this problem in the early dating phase. They focus on one person too quickly even when the guy is not giving them signs of wanting to take things forward with them.
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I reveal how you can raise your value with the guy you’re seeing and explain the importance of creating other opportunities if your guy isn’t committing right now.

At the end of a romantic relationship, or even working one, to what extent should you cut that person out of your life entirely?
 
Some of us do this immediately. We burn all our bridges.
 
We scream, yell, and as a matter of pride we declare to ourselves that we’ll never associate with them again. But is that a good way to end things?
 
I don’t always think so. We can also get punished later on for being too stubborn in life.
 
In this week’s LOVELife video, I explain exactly when it’s ok to burn a relationship and when you should leave the door open for some kind of future (even if right now that idea sounds too painful…).

It’s easy to feel jealous of our partner’s past, or even just sad that we weren’t a part of it.
 
They’ve been through so much without us.
 
Not only have they had other relationships, they’ve also travelled to other countries, had incredible experiences, and been through ups and downs that we don’t even know about.
 
In this week’s LOVELife, we tackle the problem of how to deal with the jealousy we can feel when we think of those experiences we’ve missed out on having with our partner for the first time..

You’re on a date with a guy. 

You’re both sharing stories. He tells you that he plays the guitar. You notice that he seems really proud when he tells you about playing his first gig. 

Then without missing a moment, you start enthusiastically telling him about your friend who’s also in a band, is the best guitarist you’ve ever seen, and has just released and album.

Suddenly, his eyes narrow and he seems emotionally checked out, maybe even hurt. 

Why? What happened?

In this week’s video, I’m going to reveal why this kind of “story-trumping” is so dangerous, and why it’s can be such a turnoff to guys in dating.

At the end of a romantic relationship, or even working one, to what extent should you cut that person out of your life entirely?
 
Some of us do this immediately. We burn all our bridges.
 
We scream, yell, and as a matter of pride we declare to ourselves that we’ll never associate with them again. But is that a good way to end things?
 
I don’t always think so. We can also get punished later on for being too stubborn in life.
 
In this week’s LOVELife video, I explain exactly when it’s ok to burn a relationship and when you should leave the door open for some kind of future (even if right now that idea sounds too painful…).

▼
I’m about to share some secret phrases that no man can resist hearing. I’m always scared to give these away, so promise me you’ll use them for good…;)

These phrases, when used on a guy, will give the ability you:

- Stay in his memory

- Make him feel like more of a man around you

- Override his logical brain and get him to melt in your presence

But first: you need to know the difference between compliments and flattery.

A compliment is a comment that feels earnt. It’s what makes a guy know that you see the best in him and it makes him want to be his best self around you. 

Flattery is just pumping a guy’s ego. It’s what you get when a woman simply throws praise at guy even if he’s done nothing to deserve it. 

Hint: The second one doesn’t work when you’re trying to attract men. 

In this week’s video then, I share my THREE all-time favorite MAN-MELTING COMPLIMENTS proven to work on any guy that still allow you to remain high-value...

You’ve turned into a jealous person.
 
You’ve started wondering about texts on his phone. More than one time he’s given you reason to doubt whether he’s telling the truth and now you’re always questioning him and playing detective.
 
But…you also love him and you’re great together.
 
Should you break up just to be safe? In this week’s episode of LOVELife we tackle the ultimate dilemma: Can you stay in a relationship where there isn’t 100% trust, or should you stay and give him the benefit of the doubt?

Do your words escape you on a first date?

You know you’re an interesting person, but sit you next to a guy, order a drink, and then find you don’t know what tosay and suddenly you can’t find anything to talk about! 
 
Should you just randomly grab a topic? Movies? His shirt? The ""crazy"" weather we've been having lately?! (heaven forbid).
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, we go through some REALLY simple conversational foundations that will make you engaging and ensure you never run out of things to talk about.

You’ve been on two or three dates with a guy.
 
On paper, he seems great. Well-educated, kind, good career, knows how to dress himself.
 
But you just don’t get those butterflies when you think about him. You don’t feel that tingle of passion you’ve felt with other guys you liked in the past.
 
Should you give him another try? Or lose him now and move on so that you don’t waste anymore time?
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, my brother Stephen and I talk to a caller who is struggling with this dilemma of choosing between CHEMISTRY or COMPATIBILITY, and determine whether it’s smart to go after one at the expense of the other.

He sends you a text message. It says “miss u”.

Every magazine tells you how to have great sex, how to spice up your marriage, and what positions to try when you’re bored.
 
But what really gets men hooked sexually on one woman isn't some secret sex position...

It's when he feels comfortable being able to express all of his dirty thoughts WITHOUT being judged.

When we’re with someone long enough, we become used to them. They become our best friend. That’s when it becomes scary to reveal a new, kinky, sexual desire with the person we love.
 
In this week’s episode of iHeart, we talk about how to get out of this feeling of being “trapped” sexually, so that both men and women can create an environment where they truly become one another's sexual fantasy (as well as loving partner)!

“I’m just not ready to be exclusive with anyone…”

There’s no good way to hear that sentence from a guy’s mouth. 

Maybe he’s focusing on his career. Maybe he’s travelling the world this year and won’t have time for a relationship. Or maybe...potentially...it’s just his BS excuse because he wants to play the field and enjoy the sexual delights of the bachelor lifestyle.

All that matters is this...what does it mean for you?

I’ve seen so many women handle this conversation in TERRIBLE ways. They get upset, angry, emotional – giving up months and months trying to win him over and convince him to be in a relationship.

I know this sucks, but I’m going to show you EXACTLY what to say in your response to a guy in this moment so that you feel empowered, confident, and in control of your romantic destiny again

Remember, it’s not what other people do that defines the quality of our love life, but how we respond to what other people do.

Why do so many guys turn out to be jerks?? Maybe you’re unlucky. Or maybe men just suck as a gender. But then you realise those are just dumb beliefs.

Then  you consider ANOTHER terrifying possibility: what if YOU are the problem?? What if you’re doing something to attract the bad guys without even knowing why? In this week’s blog video, I want to put this issue to rest once and for all. So many women ask me how to avoid crappy men, and so many times I always want to give the same answer. So here it is…hope you’re ready for me to lay down some serious TRUTH today!

So, it’s January... You feel pumped, focused, ready to find love, money, success, happiness, etc. You have goals. But you still wonder: Am I actually going to achieve them all? In fact, I’m willing to bet that for at least ONE of your New Year’s resolutions you still haven’t made any progress yet.

Sucks right?

Most people write down goals, throw the notepad in a drawer, and completely forget about them until a year later when they wonder why they never lost those 10 pounds, or why they never started that business, or why they never made that extra $10,000 dollars a year. The reason is because they lack an action plan for every single day.

Let’s face it, words matter.

Especially in relationships when you want to hear your partner’s feelings. And that means you want him to say the words “I love you” every week rather than once every 6 months!

But what if your guy never says loving things to you?

In this week’s episode of LOVELife I talk with a caller who wishes her guy was more affectionate in her relationship. If you can relate to this problem, you’ll hear my BEST strategy for communicating your romantic needs and getting him to say “I love you” without needing to be asked all the time.

Ok, you asked for it…

I have no idea why, but whenever I post videos of myself doing something stupid, people always beg for more!

Well, who am I to spoil the fun? ;)

Introducing: my best bloopers of 2015!

I probably spent anywhere up to 500 hours on camera last year, and fortunately, my cameraman Jameson makes sure that most of that footage never sees the light of day.

But every now and then people ask: where are all those videos where Matt screwed up? Where he acted like a weirdo and made a fool of himself? 

Fear not. There’s more than enough to chew on here!

Do you have a vision of a perfect guy in your head? Could you settle for anything less than that?
 
That’s the question we all ask ourselves when we're single.
 
Maybe he’s messy, maybe he’s moody, maybe he just doesn’t have a job that interest you. But which of these should you pay attention to, and which should you let slide?
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I talk to a caller who wants to know whether she should wait for someone who meets all her criteria, or whether she should compromise on what she wants for a relationship.

***
Last week, I sent you a kind of crazy video about dick-pics. I hope you enjoyed it. If you didn’t catch it, make sure to go check it out on my YouTube channel when you get the chance.The reason I made that video (apart from it being some goofy fun) was because I had heard so many women on my tour ask me the same question: “Why do so many guys send me unwanted pictures of their dicks?”

As a normal man (i.e. a man who doesn’t send unsolicited pictures of my exposed penis to women I’ve never met), I was shocked by how many women had experience of this phenomenon. So in this week’s video, I want to talk more openly about the psychology behind this and explain how to respond if it happens to you (which is hopefully never, but just in case!).

I’ve seen all the Christmas movies.
 
I’ve heard the same messages: “It’s not about the presents”.
 
People say the holidays are about spending time with the people we love.
 
But is that really enough?
 
In this week’s episode of LOVE LIFE, I’m posing a special challenge to all of you spending time with family and friends this Christmas.
 
Don’t settle for awkward conversation over Turkey this holiday. Watch this video and make the most of this time now so that you don’t waste this golden opportunity to connect with the people you love!

Well, this was a crazy and unexpected Christmas delight! LOL

I can honestly say in all my years of coaching and hosting retreats I’ve never had 120 women all singing me a Christmas song with my name in it!

Yet that’s exactly what happened when I got in from lunch on Day 4 of my retreat. 

You’ve got to see this…I dare the next set of retreat women to top this one!

Happy Holidays wherever you are :-)

I don’t quite know how to ask you this, but here goes: Have you ever received a picture of a guy’s junk?

I know a lot of women have.

I recently asked this at a seminar and was stunned at just how many women had been victims of this weird, insecure, pathetic behaviour from guys.

So my camera-man Jameson and I got our heads together and decided it was time to delve into the history of this bizarre phenomenon. This short video charts the results of what we discovered. ;)

It’s time we called out these men and reveal the true insecurity behind one of the great mysteries of our times. Namely: Just why the hell do some guys send women pictures of their dicks?

***
Can a woman make the first move online?
 
Yes!
 
People tend to overthink their initial approach when it comes to online dating, but the trick is twofold:
 
(1) Keep it simple

(2) Stand out so that you get his attention

 
As a woman, you should treat online dating as a fun place to try out different approaches, play, and have great interactions with different types of guys.
 
In this week’s episode of iHeart, I share THREE super practical messages that any woman can send to turn a guy’s head and make him desperate to get back to her. Write these down for yourself and try them today!

We made it, 2015 is nearly over. 
 
But never fear, the holidays are around the corner. That always ends the year on a joyful note, right?
 
Right?
 
The holidays can be a strange time. You know you’re supposed to be having fun and celebrating, and maybe you are.
 
But it’s also easy for this to be the most stressful time of the year. This might for any number of reasons:
 
· You’re wondering if your career is on the right path.
 
· You’re wondering if your parents are going to bug you at the dinner table with the same annoying conversations.
 
·  You’re wondering if you can be bothered with all the stress of parties with co-workers and endless worrying about getting the right presents.
 
It can be overwhelming. Maybe you want to just curl up in bed and just hide under a blanket for the holidays while you eat your weight in chocolate. 
 
But don’t waste this time.
 
Forget all the advertising and nonsense, in this video, I’m going to show you that the holidays really can be a magical time if you appreciate what they’re for and know how to enjoy them.

- Should you date a guy who lives in another city

- What to do if the sex is bad in a relationship

 
And of course, most importantly of all: Where do I stand on soft vs. hard tacos?

Have you ever dreamt of winning the jackpot and getting rich beyond your wildest dreams?

Perhaps you’ve fantasized about getting your “big break” after taking one huge risk and stepping into a life of wealth and fame beyond your wildest dreams.I don’t want to be a killjoy here: but those things only really happen in the movies. Check out this short video to find out why.

Living the life of our dreams rarely EVER happens because of one single moment.

When you see someone who has a career, or a relationship they truly adore, it’s not because they suddenly transformed everything in a single day. What you’ll actually find is that they are always BUILDING a successful life through tiny 1% improvements every single day.

But it’s not always easy to know how to do this.

Which is why I’m delighted to announce something very special I’ve been working on for a long time. I’m finally ready to release it to the world.

Drum roll…

I’m launching my first ever PODCAST!

From now on, you’ll be able to subscribe and get regular episodes every few days so that you can build new skills and techniques and watch your life transform over the next 6 months. I’ve worked ridiculously hard at putting this all together, and I couldn’t be prouder to finally share it with you.

Take a peek now and get excited!

“I’m Crazy For Him, But He Lives In Another Country. Am I Screwed?”

I get asked about long-distance relationships every single day.
 
Everyone has that same problem: “I fell for him, he’s perfect. He’s the only one I want. But he lives in another country! Help!”
 
It’s a scary moment.
 
Do you risk all that time on something you don’t know will pay off? Or do you put on your realistic hat and tell yourself it can never work?
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I talk to a caller who is in a major long-distance dilemma. Instead of rushing into anything crazy, we talk about the absolute KEY questions that have to be answered before you make the leap and have a relationship with a guy who lives far away.

As a native Brit, I never grew up with Thanksgiving.

Yet, I’ve always loved the idea of a holiday that existed purely for the sake of showing gratitude (and eating your weight in turkey and stuffing, of course!). So since moving to the US I’ve had a real soft spot for this annual tradition. 

As the holidays are upon us now December’s just about to arrive, it’s a time when I’m sure you’ll be wanting to appreciate the special people in your life. 

My first tip for doing this? Don’t stress out!

The trick to giving a meaningful gift is ridiculously simple, as you’ll find out in this week’s video.

By the way, at the end I’ll be giving away an early holiday gift of my own, so make sure you watch all the way through to get your copy!

Let me also take my chance now to say that one thing I’m truly thankful for is all of your support. 

It means the world to me to be able to have another year of interacting with so many amazing people through the work I do. It is truly a privilege and I appreciate anyone who comments, comes to my events, or just follows what we do online. 

Thank you.

Losing someone you love after a break up is like finding yourself out alone in the wilderness wondering how you’re ever going to make it home again.
 
You know things are going to get worse before they get better.
 
But the beautiful realization comes when we realise we can always come back stronger and still be open-hearted in our attitude to love.
 
In this week’s LOVELife, I speak to a caller who feels completely alone after a rough break up, and needs to find herself again. I talk her through some practical steps and mindset changes that anyone can use who feels lost after a relationship has ended.
 
The dark periods are always there in life, but we can also choose how long we’re going to remain in them.

So…it looks like even though my One Direction video came out less than a week ago people have already been asking for bloopers. 

Well screw it, why not? 

Disclaimer: I tend to get a little goofy and mentally unhinged when I’m shooting videos into the wee hours. Don’t say I didn’t warn you! ;)

This isn't a bash at One Direction personally, who I'm sure are lovely guys. Just thought we'd have some fun with their lyrics ;)

I have no idea why I agreed to this. I can’t sing. I can’t play guitar. But apparently I CAN act like an idiot

Full ""Perfect"" song lyrics:

I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn’t do
Baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can’t even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now

I might never be the hand you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don’t mean that we can’t live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

When I first saw you
From across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you’re sure
What you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises

Thanks for coming to my channel!

People call me a “dating coach”. Others call me a “love guru”, or “relationship expert”. 

I hate all these titles, but to put it simply, I teach women the secrets of attraction and reveal the hidden insights into men’s behaviour when it comes to dating. 

I’m a New York Times Bestselling Author of a book called “Get The Guy”, a columnist for Cosmopolitan magazine, and I host a radio show called LOVELife on iHeart Radio. 

This is my place where I come to talk about dating tips, love advice, modern relationships, and sometimes just to geek out on movies I love and other things I think can benefit your everyday life.

If you want an easy way to get started, I recommend you go to 9texts.com and download my free guide revealing the 9 killer texts you can send any guy to get him hooked on you! 

Everything else is here on the channel. You can also find my written blogs over at howtogettheguy.com

One more thing: make sure you click subscribe if you want to make sure you get my new videos twice a week as soon as they’re posted!

Thanks,

Matt

Enough already!
 
It’s time to put an end to the stigma…
 
What stigma? I’m talking about “work-shaming”.  
 
These days, the world is always trying to tell us that we’re just not productive enough, that we lack work ethic, or that we need to take our career ever more seriously.
 
But has this gone way too far?
 
In this week’s LOVELife, I decide it’s time to stand up to this message and decide to put an end to the cycle of misery and anxiety caused by the “work-shaming” advocates.
 
Watch this video, and take on the freedom that comes from setting your OWN expectations, instead of everyone else's.

I get SO many questions from women in their 40’s and 50’s who ask me whether my advice would work for them.
 
And I always wonder: why not?
 
Of course I understand that ageing is an anxiety that all of us secretly face and worry about, especially when it comes to dating.
 
But does that really mean that the same rules no longer apply once we hit 40?
 
What is it about turning 40 that makes life so different? Is it that a 40 year-old wouldn’t flirt and go on dates? Is it that you can’t find good men once you’re 40? Is it that 40 year-olds live in some alternate universe where the rules that apply to 20 and 30-year olds no longer work?
 
Maybe I’m being dumb and naiive here, but I don’t believe any of those things.  


But I'd like to hear from you women on this issue. 

If you have an opinion, ANY opinion at all about dating in your 40's and beyond, please make sure you watch this episode of LOVELife and share your thoughts in the comments below. I’d love to hear from you.

***
You decided it’s time to break up.

And now you’re single again. But for some reason you don’t feel at peace.

You’re still haunted by that eternal question: Did I make a HUGE mistake?

Even if it was YOU who decided to call off a relationship, at some point you’re always going to get that horrible feeling inside of you that questions your decision to dump someone. Your friends and family say it’s for the best. But maybe they don’t really know. Plus, there was that one friend who advised you to give things another try with this guy and now you’re even more lost and confused!

You could be stuck forever like this. Frozen in the limbo of wondering whether you’ve made the best decision of your life, or thrown away an incredible relationship. In this week’s video, I’m going to show you an easy way to tell whether you made the right choice, and personally guide you out of this anxiety and indecision with simple but powerful change in mindset, so that you feel confident in your feelings and can let a relationship go in peace.

Believe me, I know myself how easy it is to get stuck in this place for months only to come out of it and wonder why you wasted so much of your precious time worrying.

***

I say that kindness wins in the end.

Being able to give people joy and make them feel special is still a crucial skill. Especially in business.

Yet being a nice person seems to have been downgraded in our modern culture. It’s almost become more fashionable these days to take the following attitude: If I’m good at my job, it doesn’t matter if I’m that likeable or friendly.

I couldn’t disagree more.  

In this week’s video, I talk about how being a ‘people person’ is still one of the fundamental assets of people who win in life, and why we should all be deeply concerned about how well we treat people in our every day interactions.

***
You’re in bed with a guy.

It’s the morning after the night before.

You had a great time. The sex was hot. He’s hot.

It all happened so fast. And now you’re starting to have that classic worry: Did I give it away too soon? 

Even in the modern world it’s common for women to have this feeling of anxiety after sleeping with a guy too quickly. Maybe you’re worried about he’ll lose respect you, or you want to make sure you don’t attached to him BEFORE you know whether he sees you two as a serious thing. Maybe it all just happened in the heat of the moment and you want to slow down next time before you jump into having regular sex.

Relax. Sex is to be enjoyed,

not something to be constantly agonized over. In this week’s video, I show exactly what to do next if you feel like you’ve slept with a guy too quickly, and reveal a golden line you can say to him if you want to slow things down that will make him EVEN MORE attracted to you and send his respect for you through the roof.

Remember: there’s no conflict between having a fun sex life and being high value.

 ***
I'm curious. How do you feel as a woman when a guy you've never met offers to buy you a drink?
 
Is it flattering? Or does it make you feel awkward and a little unsure of whether to accept?
 
Let’s face it, even when guys make the brave step of approaching a woman, they aren’t always exactly subtle or graceful about it.
 
It’s hard for guys to make that difficult step of putting themselves up for rejection, but there are elegant ways to do it and there are embarrassing ways.
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I talk to a guy for a change who wants to know the best way to approach a woman without doing the tired-old “buy you a drink?” line. I give some  quick, easy ways for guys to start a low-pressure conversation while still making a woman feel comfortable.

http://www.amazon.com/School-Greatness-Real-World-Living-Leaving/dp/1623365961/

************
Why don’t you have a man yet?!

Oh...you’re still single? But why?

Uh-oh. Better find a relationship while you still have time!

Any of these sound familiar? If you’re single, I’m sure they will.

Whether it’s in Hollywood romcoms, glossy magazines, or even just your mother’s nagging, there seems to be a constant assumption in the world that being single is the WORST THING EVER.

Maybe you even secretly feel this way yourself.

But you shouldn’t. Being single is totally underrated. In fact, it can be so much fun that you wonder why anyone would ever want a relationship to begin with. In this week’s blog video, I’m joined by a very special guest, my friend Lewis Howes, former pro-athlete and host of the School of Greatness podcast.

I’ve followed Lewis’s work for a while now, and I’m thrilled he agreed to come and share his top 5 reasons why being single can be the opportunity of a lifetime, and why you should savour every second of being free and unattached while you can. It’s a really fun and insightful video, with some genius practical tips for making your life extraordinary so that you can truly appreciate yourself and have a world that bring you happiness and fulfillment.  

As you know, I don’t have guests in my video blogs very often, so you can trust me when I say that Lewis provides incredible value.

Oh God. I made a huge mistake...And now a woman is punishing me for it…on stage! 

In the video you’re about to see, I’m caught in a scenario which, back when I first started as a coach, would have left me absolutely TERRIFIED and frozen with fear! 

After a rookie error on my part, a woman at my San Diego seminar decided to totally turn the tables and call me out, potentially leaving me completely embarrassed and lost for words in front my own audience.
 
For a tiny split second, my brain said what it always said in these awkward moments “Oh crap…”
 
Crap. Crap. Double Crap.
 
Luckily for me, I’ve been in this situation dozens of times before.
 
A career of standing on stage in front of hundreds of people every week has enabled me to learn more than my fair share of Jedi-mind tricks and powerful techniques for dealing with crisis scenarios like this.
 
In this week’s video, I’ve decided it’s finally time to open up the kimono and share some of my most carefully guarded secrets to maintaining your power in these difficult moments.
 
See, in life, things don’t always go the way you plan.
 
You can try and map out every scenario in your mind, but the truth is, when you get to that interview, that audition, that first date, or that difficult business pitch, it’s much harder than we imagine to respond on our feet without allowing the pressure to knock us off our game.
 
If you’re someone who needs to make sure you’re able to have impact and remain confident even in the most unpredictable moments in life, make sure you watch very closely as I put into practice my own shortcuts and processes that have taken me years of failed attempts to learn.

Make sure you view all the way to the end, because in the last minute I’m going to share something completely for free that has already changed the lives of thousands of women who have been luckily enough to get their hands on it.

***
They say that in order to find out who a woman will become in the future, look at her mother.
 
But is that true? If it is, then it must be true of men and their fathers too, right?
 
It’s a weird moment when you first spend time with your new boyfriend’s parents. You size them up, and after a while you probably start to observe moments of resemblance between your guy and his Dad.
 
Often this is harmless.
 
But what if his Dad has certain behaviours or beliefs that make you uneasy? Should you now be scared that it’s only a matter of time until your guy turns into a version of his father?
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I speak to a caller who has this exact fear, which I answer by telling a story that reveals why we should always be careful separate the parents from the child, and why we should refrain from predicting people’s behaviour based on other members of their family. I also reveal how you use one simple question to find out how likely your guy is to grow into his father.

He’s cute. He’s funny.
 
The two of you just had a great conversation and you can feel the tingle of excitement from that initial first moment of chemistry.
 
You want to get to know him better, but your friends are telling you it’s time to leave.
 
How do you get his number??
 
Quick! He’s leaving!
 
This is an all-too-common situation, and I don’t know about you, but as far as I’m concerned it’s one of those little daily tragedies that people are constantly losing potentially amazing partners simply because they don’t know the best technique for getting a guy’s phone number.

Then they wait…and wait…and nothing happens.
 
Isn’t there an easier solution? A way you can take action, but still be elegant, classy, and have him chase you at the same time?

Sometimes your love life just doesn’t budge no matter what you do.

You go on dates, meet men, get phone numbers, but everything fizzles out. 
 
What’s the deal? You know you are doing ok – you have friends, a career, things to be grateful for, but you know things are not as great as they should be in ANY area of your life, especially considering how hard you’ve worked.
 
You think about giving up. 

You want to pull the sheets over your head and stay in bed because you feel so disheartened. You just feel overwhelmed, like you have no more effort to give at this point.
 
In this episode of LOVELife, I talk to a caller who desperately needs out of this situation.
 
I talk step-by-step about WHY we get impatient in our love lives and how you can turn a bad situation around and feel positive about where you are right now, so that you can keep going even when the results aren’t coming (yet)! and making a great impression on every guest at the table.

************
Why do many women find it so difficult to talk to men they don’t know?

Especially the intimidating HOT guys. 

I couldn’t tell you how many times women approach me BEGGING for the secret to getting men to come over and say “Hi”. 

If we’re honest with ourselves, this is what we all are secretly hoping will happen. We hope we’ll find some magic spell that automatically turn heads and will get people talking to us as soon as we walk in the room.

Except there are no magic spells. 

There’s just you, standing in a room, vulnerable and hopeful, waiting...just like everyone else. 

Waiting for the cute guy to accidently brush shoulders with you and turn to engage you in witty conversation. 

Waiting for Prince Charming to run up to you on the street, get down on one knee, and ask you out there and then. 

So we all get trapped, playing the hopeless “WAITING GAME”.

It doesn’t have to be this way. 

In this, video, I show you why as a woman you don’t have to wait one second longer to start meeting great guys. 

Most women forget that even the guys they’re attracted to are only human too. They are vulnerable, wondering who to talk to, hoping that someone will come and break the ice.

You might be under the same illusion most women are: the belief that your only job is to hold tight and hope that a guy picks you out of the crowd and approaches you. 

I hope by the end of the video you’ll see why that’s such a DUMB, OUTDATED belief that holds too many women back from an incredible dating life. 

The power is in your hands.

Use it as you will.

***
I believe in the art of being a wonderful dinner guest. 

Maybe you do too. In which case, let me give you a few quick test questions:

Do you pull out the chair for another guest, or simply take your seat?

Do you show interest in what other people have to say and give them the chance to shine, or endlessly talk about yourself?
Do you leave your phone on the table, or keep it on silent in your pocket?
 
Although dinner parties don’t have to require a performance on our part, they should be a seen as a chance to display us at our best. It should be a chance for us to unveil the most charming, most charismatic, most amicable sides of our personality. 

And it should be a chance for us to show good manners.

If you’ve ever wondered how to be the guest that everyone wants to invite over again, in this weeks episode of LOVELife I give you 5 SIMPLE TIPS for blowing away your host and making a great impression on every guest at the table.

************
I’ve realised it is finally time... 

Time for me, like so many other wanderers of generations past, to head west and seek my fortune in good old California.

This week’s episode of our documentary series “Love The Journey” sees me, Jameson and Sam take the long drive down to sunny San Diego, the next city on our tour. 

You’ll see me get my hands dirty with a woman on stage, who to put it simply says: “I never want to date any of the guys who like me, but the guys I am attracted to are never interested either”.

What’s the deal with that?

If you can’t wait for the answer, watch THIS to find out.

We also decide to take a relaxing afternoon out by ticking an item off our bucket list: Going on Safari! (yes, there’ll be adorable footage of me feeding a baby rhino, why wouldn’t there be?). 

And if that wasn’t enough, I get so excited about seeing the snake and spider house that I start dancing in the middle of a zoo like a weirdo. 

Who says touring has to be a drag? 

Well...actually, to be honest, I do.

I’m not going to lie, sometimes journeying around the country, sleeping on planes, and being away from home, can feel like a long slog.

But one thing I’ve discovered about life is that you have to always remind yourself just how good things are. 

Even if what you’re doing is tough and you feel overworked right now, doesn’t mean they aren’t still great. You just have to find ways to remind yourself now and then.

What’s the best birthday present you’ve ever received?
 
Chances are that if you had to rank your favourite gifts, you wouldn’t list them all in order of how much they cost.
 
You’d rank them based on that fun memory they evoke, the way they made you feel when you opened them felt like someone had really thought about what you wanted.
 
Maybe you’d remember that feeling of being loved and cherished when someone put hours into making a present that they knew would make you feel special.
 
Being a good gift-giver is unbelievably sexy and puts us in an entirely different category to anyone else. Yet so many people put barely any thought into it.
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I reveal how you can always have a great gift ready by using ONE simple technique. 
 
If you want to make someone you love glow with happiness, check out the video and start surprising the people in your life today.

If you’re anything like me, you’ll have certain relationships in your life that you wish you could change.

It might be your parents, a close friend, a sibling, a cousin...people with whom you always get stuck in the same stale behavioural patterns.

Maybe you fight, maybe you get jealous and competitive, maybe you always feel frustrated by each other’s bad habits, maybe you wish you could show them your true emotions. 

All you know is that you’ve felt stuck for a long time now, and you wish you could feel differently about it. 

People always say “YOU CAN’T CHANGE OTHER PEOPLE”. 

And that’s true. 

But guess what? 

You CAN change your RELATIONSHIPS with other people.

Do you make promises you can't keep?

Our word is the most important thing you have. It’s the thing that builds trust, it’s what makes people value what we say.
 
Yet we all break little promises so easily.
 
Things slip through the net. We get busy. We say “sorry” because we over-promised and now have too much on our plate.
 
If you’re tired of letting people down and feeling bad for falling below your personal standard of behaviour, this week’s episode of LOVELife video is going to give you the confidence to say “NO” and show how you win more respect and admiration from your friends, family, and work colleagues by being honest about your priorities.

I still remember every heartbreak I’ve ever had. 

If I try I can still bring back the agony of those months after a relationship ended, wondering if I was ever going to feel better and get back to my normal self. When you’re feeling that pain of losing someone, food doesn’t taste good. TV shows depress you. Your favourite places feel cursed because they bring back bittersweet memories. Life feels like white noise, and your every waking moment goes back to that feeling of loss and pain.

We’ve all been there, right? But there is a secret to emotionally recovering from a breakup, one that is shockingly simple but so crucial that if you forget to do it, you will inadvertently DOUBLE the amount of time it takes to get over your ex. See, most of us make bad decisions in a breakup. We drink to numb the pain, we have one-night stands with people we don’t care about, or we eat ourselves into oblivion with junk food.

It sucks now, I know. But it will get better, trust me....

When we first date someone, we can’t keep our hands off them. All we want to do is take them home and spend all night in bed together. But what about when the infatuation stage is over? Can you still keep up the chase even though you’re both in a stable and comfortable relationship?
 
In this week’s episode of LOVELife, I explain the psychology behind why so many couples get lazy and lose attraction over time, and show how you can avoid that by taking on a few key behaviors to boost the DESIRE in your relationship so that you and your partner always feel irresistibly attracted to each another.

http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/thescripts...

**
Imagine your boyfriend just introduced you to his attractive, funny and cool “best friend”, who also happens to be a woman. 

What do you feel? Awkward? Uncomfortable? I don’t blame you. It’s that eternal puzzle: Can men and women ever be just friends? Most people respond to seeing their partner having friends of the opposite sex in the worst possible ways: anger, jealousy, coldness. Or...they choose an even worse strategy. 

They avoid the issue entirely and become resentful, until one day they just explode and make a HUGE messy scene. 

Both of these are wrong.

In this week’s video, I reveal exactly under what circumstances you should accept your guy having female friends, and show you the TWO THINGS he must do before you should feel comfortable with the situation.

What do you do if your guy keeps ""liking"" sexy pics of other women on social media?

It's always difficult telling a guy that his behaviour is inappropriate, especially in the early stages of dating.

In this week's LOVELife, I talk about how to confront a guy and uphold your standard so that he understands your point of view (and what to do if he accuses you of being ""jealous"" or ""high-maintenance"").

Be honest, maybe you have an exam coming up...

Maybe you have bills to pay...

Maybe a family situation is giving you anxiety...

Maybe you just STILL don’t know where your career is going…

Big or small, we always have to deal with stress. And those stresses can pile up and completely overwhelm you to the point where you just give up, feeling defeated.

Most people walk around in a constant state of anxiety, feeling tense 24 hours a day, powerless to deal with these daily worries. I don’t want that for you. 

Instead, make sure you employ THIS deceptively simple mental strategy to become 5x more productive and stop stress getting the better of you EVER AGAIN.

Want to know ONE  essential secret to becoming a success? First provide value to others.

A lot of people are good at this part. 

Yet they then say to me “Matt, I’m fine with providing value. But I don’t feel comfortable actually charging people money for what I do. Acting like a hustling salesperson isn’t my style”.

I hear this complaint all the time from people who want to start businesses and begin as entrepreneurs. 

They work and slave their guts out trying to make an incredible product, only to feel guilty about promoting their work.

I don’t want you to feel that guilt ~Contact.FirstName~

That’s why in this episode of LOVELife, I teach you how to capture the maximum value for your efforts and how to get over any guilt about earning money for your passion

Barbecue, Beer, and Bluegrass music...

Flying into Dallas I knew that it was time to really let loose.

I've found that lately when I travel I tend to just exist in and out of hotel rooms and barely get to know the city I've just visited.

Not this time…

We never have as much time as we think to get out and enjoy the world in front of us.

When I think about this it always reminds me that although having your eyes on the goal is important, only a fool doesn’t stop to have fun along the way.

This episode is all about how to REALLY live while you can and get the most out of your traveling (even when it's supposed to be a work trip).

Sometimes, even when time is tight on the journey, you have to squeeze every drop of juice out of life, especially when you never know when you're going to return to a place again.

So saddle up and watch Me, Jameson and Sam tear into Texas (as well as about a whole month's worth of meat).

FACT: Your partner is attractive. (After all, whether it’s because of his looks, his personality, or both, YOU are attracted to him!)

FACT: It’s inevitable that other women are going to find your partner attractive.

So what do you do when you look across the room and catch another woman flirting with your man? You could view it as a threat, become jealous and needy, and even storm over to the two of them and break it up… OR you could do THIS, which puts you back in control and actually builds the kind of trust that lasts. 

I’ve been getting lots of emails from women asking how to deal with this tricky situation, so I’ve devoted this week’s video to a deep dive into practical, actionable advice you can use right away…

Be sure to leave a comment and let me know how it works out for you.

I have a sneaky psychology secret that will make you everyone’s #1 priority if you only know how to use it…

It’s all based on the fact that most people don’t set their priorities for their day ahead of time, and end up focusing on what seems urgent right in front of them. 

In this week’s video blog, I’m showing you how you can become top-of-mind to anyone, whether it’s your boss, your client, or the guy you’re hoping will ask you out for Saturday night…

Use this trick and you’ll get the result you want quicker than you ever have before…

***
It’s 5am on a cold, wet Toronto morning…

My alarm buzzes in my hotel room and wakes me from my fitful sleep. My throat is sore and my body aches, and it doesn’t feel like the antibiotics are helping at all. I want to just pull the covers over my head and shut out the world until I feel better.

But I can’t…

I’m in Toronto for my Matthew Hussey Live tour, and I have four media appearances – 2 radio shows, co-hosting a TV show, and a magazine interview – followed by the sold-out 6-hour live event.

“Just getting through it” is not an option. I have to deliver my best no matter what. So what inspires me to push through and give all I’ve got (and more)?

That’s what this episode of “Love the Journey” is all about, so I’m dedicating this one to you…

Today I’m handing you 4 elegantly effective techniques to get your point of view across in a way that is certain, passionate and compassionate at the same time. Not only will you win, but you’ll win people over.

You had an amazing date with your new guy. The candlelit restaurant was so romantic, you 

talked for hours about everything, the wine was flowing, you could barely keep your hands off each other in the cab and, before you knew it, you were waking up the next morning at his place.

As you were about to leave his apartment, though, that blissful feeling suddenly gave way to 

sheer panic – 

Will he think about you after you’re gone? 

Will he call? 

Will he want to see you again?

Maybe there is something you can do to guarantee he sees you again, you think…

But wait –Before you “accidentally” leave that necklace behind on his nightstand, heed my warning:

Don’t Make THIS Mistake When You Spend the Night

I'm guilty…

Like most men, I had fallen into the habit of only texting women instead of picking up the phone and calling.

It’s quick, it’s convenient, and I assumed it was the preferred method to keep in touch between dates – that is, until I met HER…

The woman who completely changed my mind.

The woman who used ONE brilliant line to literally re-train me to stop texting and actually pick up the phone and call her every time.

She didn't have to nag me, or even come right out and ask me…

But this one thing she said stuck in my brain, raised her value, and made me want to treat her differently than all other women.

I’m going to share with you this brilliant line in today’s video – it’s part of a crazy-simple, 3-step process you can use right away to get this same amazing result with the men in your life…

I’ll also reveal the one thing you MUST have if you want to get past the first date and get asked out a second, third and fourth time… and I’ll tell you exactly how to get it.

And don't forget to watch all the way to the end of the video, because I've got HUGE NEWS for you…

Rachel's been out on a date with a guy she really likes. The only problem? She wants to marry a Jewish man...and he's not Jewish. What's the harm in dating him anyway? Is it possible to ""just have fun"" and not get attached? I tackle this tough question in this week's LOVELife...

************
“This moment contains all moments.” – C.S. Lewis 

I love that quote so much, because it beautifully expresses what I believe is the most magical thing about life – its infinite possibilities. 

Each moment brings us new opportunities to meet amazing people, to learn and discover, to grow, to experience joy, and yes – to fall in love… 

This weeks video is Part 3 of my mini-documentary series, “Love the Journey.” 

Come along with me to Chicago as I prepare for my live event there.

We'll take a ride in a tricked-out limousine, check out Jameson and my hotel room, have some laughs (and a non-alcoholic beer) with my team, and step out on stage in front of hundreds of incredible women to help them find the love they so deserve. 

You won’t want to miss a moment…

************
When you’re dating a guy, you’re going to get frustrated with him sometimes. It’s inevitable.

What you DO have control over is how you respond.

And this is important, because how you choose to voice your frustrations can mean the 

difference between inspiring him to change his behavior, and ticking him off and making him 

leave.

In this week’s video, I share my simple 2-step plan to let your guy know you’re upset in a way 

that will actually improve your relationship…

Have you ever gotten physical on a first date and then worried that your guy would lose interest?
That's the dilemma on Carlene's mind on this week's episode of LOVElife. Turns out the 
real danger to a budding relationship isn't making out too soon, it's OVERANALYZING 
his every move. The secret to making it work is ""zooming out,"" as I explain in my answer..

You asked for it, and I delivered…

It’s time for another episode of “Sexy Potatoes!”

This week we’re talking about “American Hustle.”

Now I realize that a movie about con men and the mafia doesn’t sound romantic, but there are actually 3 big love lessons in this film that I’m really excited to share with you. 

Pay special attention to lesson #3 – it’s an important one about how much you should invest of yourself in a relationship…

I know you’re going to get a lot out of this week’s video, including a good laugh (yes, that’s me doing my best attempt at an American gangster accent).

Rejection hurts, whether it's finding out that the cute guy you've had your eye on already has a girlfriend, or chatting up a man all night who never asks for your number. But how do you survive the most painful – and personal – rejection when the man you're seeing decides he doesn't want to be with you anymore? I've got the answer in this week's LOVELife...

I get asked a lot of tough questions – from how to attract amazing guys, to why they disappear, to what say to get a commitment – and after coaching women for years, I have no trouble answering them…

But there is one question that is, surprisingly, the toughest of all for me to answer: “Where do you live?”

With all of the traveling I do for my live tour, I’m rarely in the same city for a week at a time.

But no matter where in the world I am, the moment I step on stage to coach thousands of women like you, I’m HOME.

And that’s what happiness is all about, isn’t it? Loving your life right where you are…

This week’s video blog is the second part of my mini-documentary series, “Love the Journey.” In it, I take you with me to New York City as I prepare for my live event there.

Living this life I love so much would not be possible without you and I’m so excited to share it now with you!

I’m not going to let that happen to you.

In this week's episode of LOVELife, I take a question from Khalani on why, with modern day dating, most men are hesitant to jump into a relationship. We also discuss how she can be more trusting when meeting men who are looking for more than a casual fling. Enjoy!

We all have people in our lives whose word we've learned not to believe.

You've given them so many chances in the past that your faith in them to deliver has eroded.

Now, as easy as it is to think about and get frustrated with others, is this something you could ever be guilty of yourself?

With all of the hype around the holidays you’d think that EVERYONE has someone special to share them with. 

The romantic movies, the songs about kissing under the mistletoe, the TV commercials where men drop to one knee beside the Christmas tree and pull out a sparkly diamond ring… It’s enough to make a single girl completely STRESSED! 

Even if you don’t have any prospects in sight, it’s still not too late to find someone special to kiss on New Year’s Eve.

This week's video is about everything you can do this December to create more opportunities than you ever have before, with the ultimate goal of getting the romance you want in time for the holidays.

It's late Friday evening, your friends are calling to invite you out, but you can't muster the energy to go…

The couch and blanket look all too enticing, and the idea of getting ready and going out to socialise overwhelms you.

If this is a pattern you regularly find yourself trapped in, today I have something to help.

It's easy to fall into a trap of making excuses; especially to have your love life take the back seat to everything else going on in life. If you find yourself putting off your love life to some point in the future that will be the 'right time', this is one you need to watch. In this week's episode of LOVELife, I talk to Chantelle and dissect this excuse for anyone in the same boat.

He can be on the other side of the room...

You don't have to say a word…

You don't have to risk rejection…

And it's so ridiculously simple, when I show you, you're going to wonder why you haven't been doing this all along.

It received an overwhelming response, with one question being asked over and over in the comments...

…""What do I say if my answer is zero? What if I'm a virgin?""

If that's you, whether you believe in 'no sex before marriage', or are just on the fence about when to get intimate with someone for the first time, you'll want to check out this video...

It's almost inevitable you're going to get asked...

When you do, how do you answer?

Do you need to talk about it or can the topic be avoided?

This week Jameson sent me a video of a coach giving a speech to a little-league baseball team after they'd just lost a huge game.

The kids are sobbing, you can see how much the game meant to them, and the speech that followed was something you've got to see…

It's a lesson for life on being a fighter, not quitting, and taking pride in the things that really matter.

The solution couldn't be simpler, and it's something you can employ on your very next date!

It's time to take things up a notch and introduce my dad.

I attribute a huge amount of my success to this man, and for the first time ever, we've gotten together on camera.

The two of us bring back one of my favourite segments ""Boring Heroes"" and tell the story of someone who embodies the secret to becoming a passionate person.

I know you have an excuse that's stopping you from getting what you want.

Maybe it's your age, how you look, or lack of time...

Whatever it is that's holding you back, it needs to be gotten over, and I want to show you exactly how to do that...

***

What's your excuse?

- Is it true? Are you using it too much? Have you decided it's going to make you weaker or stronger? (you can choose either path)

Write it down, analyse it, and realise you have the power to turn it into something that can actually be a gift.

Don't be afraid to innovate. Don't be confined to one thing. Give yourself the space to manoeuvre, and try different things within your personality.

Challenge: Next time you go out, can you go the entire time without getting into the subject of your work? (or whatever it might be you usually latch onto in conversation)

Take a risk and challenge yourself by testing the limits of your own charisma and confidence.

Arousal, desire, lust... all good things.

But in the back of your mind are you also feeling hesitant, timid or unsure?

-- The technique of 'positive reinforcement' so in just 10 words you can get him to do *everything* you want

-- How to bring up dirty talk with a guy (something every guy secretly wants)

-- And how to show a guy how to please you without embarrassment

In this week's episode of LOVELife I talk about the women who say ""all my friends are guys"" and how doing this seeming removes someone from having to compete with other women. There's a danger of seeming arrogant when doing this and losing feminine energy. Enjoy!

I've seen a lot of references recently to how the media is affecting how we think and behave.

We recently had the mass shooting in California, and a lot of blame is being put on mainstream culture for how it degrades women and treats them as objects.

We have Beyonce's new album which many people have rallied against, saying it's too sexually explicit, and that it overly sexualises everything for those who look up to her as a role model.

Every time something goes wrong we come back to the media and talk about the effect it's having on culture. 

In today's video I discuss the extent to which media really does effect our focus, and ask...

Can We Blame The Media?

One of the most attractive traits we have is our energy.

An amazing energy is something that all men look for in a partner, and something we should all strive to cultivate.

The best way to develop such an energy is to get around incredible people who will bring you up to their level. 'You are the average of the 5 people that you spend most time with' as the old saying goes... however, spending your entire day around incredible people isn't always in our control.

Whether at work, out at a restaurant, or waiting in line at the bank, we're constantly in situations where the people around us have power to influence our state.

It's inevitable we'll be around negativity, and so today I want to ask:

How can you make yourself IMMUNE to negative energy?

In this week's video we're talking... 

Obsession, overanalyses, and overvaluing.

I explain why:

--Most other women are not your competition

--Hot guys aren't used to being approached (and how to use this in your favour), and...

--Why you become a nervous, uncharismatic wreck around a guy you consider attractive (and hot to stop this!)

Would You Date Yourself? This is an important question to ask yourself.

What do you want in the man (or woman) you're going to be with? What standards do you have for them?

Do you hold yourself to the same standards?

***

Standards are a double edged sword.

On one hand they can raise your game, allow you to get the best out of people, and ensure you have the right foundation for a relationship you're embarking on. 

However...

They can also be used as a protective shield, preventing you from meeting people you could otherwise have an incredible connection with.

After the first 7 Get The Guy Tour events this topic is hot on my mind right now as I've been asked about them at nearly every stop.

In this video I take you through a 3-step process to determine whether your standards are helping or hindering you, and what to do if it's the latter.

Have you ever found yourself in the position of making a really bad mistake?

We all have, and such situations are unavoidable in life.

The more important question I want to ask today is: 

--How did you handle it? 

See we all mess up from time to time, and something I've recently been reminded of is that it's not what happens that matters; it's how you REACT to what happens.

In this week's video I share a story of how I screwed up last week in front of *millions* of people.

This might get me in trouble...

But there's something today I have to tell you.

There's a belief that many of us have that I see destroying relationships, that's the cause of chronic relationship hopping, and that sets women with a completely unachievable expectation in their love lives.

I've come armed with statistics to back up what I'm saying, and while the message might initially rattle you, my hope is it leaves you with a far more empowering mindset than the one you have right now.

***
I had an incredible time in both Toronto and Winnipeg. However, travelling around and meeting lots of new people outside of these events led me to coming up with the topic of today's video...

In travelling, you end up meeting a lot of new people whom you want to have interesting things to talk about with.

I often come across people who struggle with this.

Whenever I think about people who have a hard time getting a conversation going, I think of how they sensor themselves too much; not allowing themselves to say the thing that's on their mind.

I like to make the comparison with writers and the common problem 'writer's block'. Whenever someone experiences this, it's because the standard for what they want to write is too high.

If it can never be good enough for you, you end up not writing anything.

And how do you get through this to go on to become a better writer? You write more.

Stephen King said ""write for the waste paper basket"". 

In writing for the trash can you have nothing to worry about, and no expectation to live up to.

I think people have to approach conversation the same way.

If your problem is awkward silences or not being able to keep a conversation going, you have to lower your standards for what comes out of your mouth.

Be prepared to say things other people might think are ridiculous or boring, because as you talk more, you get feedback and learn what's interesting.

Christopher Hitchens said ""self publish, even in conversation"". I love this idea, as with every sentence you're publishing another thought.

Most people spend their lives self-editing, not self-publishing - which leads to not awkward silences as they've edited before they've created anything.

I know there will be many conversational situations where you feel you don't have anything to contribute. Of course the cure for that is to ask questions and to be curious.

People who are intensely curious about life never struggle for conversation.

If you are genuinely interested in something, people will be interested in answering as they will feel your curiosity.

So lower your standard for what you have to say, self-publish liberally, and in the absence of knowing about a subject, ask about it.

***
Today we're talking about the strange phenomenon right now of young teenage girls posting videos on Youtube asking the question, 'am I pretty or ugly?'

If you look these up, you'll see that many finish with the line ""please be honest"".

Now, when I first saw these videos, I thought they were disturbing.

The comments on the videos vary radically from ""stop valuing yourself like this, you're beautiful; you shouldn't be asking strangers opinions on this"" to ""you are beautiful"" (validating them for doing it) to ""you're incredibly ugly"".

Now why are people doing this?

What strikes me as perhaps the scariest part of this is that we have failed to educate these people on where real value comes from, and what will end up being valued when they grow up.

The beauty obsession of young girls shows a fundamental misunderstanding of what's going to be important later on.

Even when looking at most relationships, I've never known a guy who will be miserable with someone for the rest of his life, just because the person he's with is hot. Guys leave these people; beauty does not keep someone around when they're not happy.

We need to bring value through what we know, by the things we learn, by the ways we make the world a better place, and by the things we create.

Beauty is only one way people bring a very superficial form of value to the table.

I often think it would be interesting if we lived in a world where everyone was born looking the same, and you got better looking based on the amount of value you added to the world. It would make beauty actually mean something, but that's not the world we live in!

It's easy to blame Youtube, magazines and celebrities, but the fact is, it really comes down to education. 

How much can you educate the person that you care about that their real value comes from what they bring to the world, not from the way they look.

I want to get to a place where kids are instead posting on Youtube speeches they make at school, asking for feedback to get better. I'd love to see kids posting a joke online to ask whether people find it funny or not. I'd love to see people showing their value, and then getting people to rate that - as then they're getting validation for something that took creativity and effort, and they're putting their attention towards something they can actually change and work on. 

That's where real empowerment comes from.

I want to make sure you make this year incredible. I also want to make sure you begin to get your love life in shape this January. I've put together something I really want you to go through that's designed to help.

In it I outline '6 Shortcuts To True Love' - which is a series of PDFs kickstart your love life in the first 30 days of the year.

***

The New Year is officially here. I hope you're excited about 2014!

If you've had a 'false-start' and feel like the first 5 days of the year haven't really gotten off to the amazing level of change you wanted, don't worry, let's begin TODAY.

New Year's is a time when people expect a lot from themselves. It's also a time when we feel pressure to change and upgrade our lives.

I believe there are 3 big mistakes people make in the New Year that are very often made worse by the advice we're usually given.

1) Taking On Too Many Resolutions

People take on a huge number of resolutions to try and justify themselves in the New Year. In doing so they take on a level of change that's not sustainable.

The key to change at the beginning of the year is the same key to change at any other time... 

Make a 1% shift.

Our lives are changed more by the one routine we stick to than the ten new ones we fail to take on.

Pick a change that you know you're going to stick to, as in sticking to it you're going to gain momentum if confidence, which will drive you to making even greater change as the year progresses.

2) Making New Year's Out To Be The Only Chance For Change

We shouldn't have the psychology that we can only create change in our lives at one opportunity of the year.

We should think of the New Year happening on the first of every month so that we have twelve times throughout the year to stop and re-evaluate our lives.

3) Thinking A Small Failure Means Absolute Failure

There's a dumb way to fail, and there's a smart way to fail.

The dumb way is giving up on a resolution just because one small thing went wrong. The smart way is to decide that a little hiccup is an anomaly - and not the rule.

For example, if you made being more sociable your resolution, in going out and not talking to anyone new for the first hour, just tell yourself it's okay and that 'failure' is part of the process. You can still be sociable the second part of the night, and get straight back on the horse.

876,stq6OeCN874,2014-01-02T13:47:44Z,My 3 EASY TRICKS To Make First Dates Less AWKWARD | Matthew Hussey,"Subscribe to my VIP videos (not on youtube) at http://www.howtogettheguy.com/advice

***
First dates are primed to be awkward. 

We're going out with someone we've met for only 5 or 10 minutes usually, perhaps not at all, and so first dates have the potential to be extremely awkward if you don't set yourself up in the right way.

Here are 3 quick tips to make the whole process smoother and less awkward...

1) Touch early and often

A mistake people often make is that as they don't know someone well, and because they don't want to seem too keen, they don't get at all tactile.

The problem with this in the first part of a date is that the longer you leave it before introducing touch, the more awkward touch becomes.

For a guy, the most pain-staking, horrible scenario is the time when you've barely touched the woman you're with throughout the entire date, and at the end you want to kiss her. This makes the move of only a few centimetres feel like a mountain to climb.

Touch allows for a smoother transition through each stage.

As a woman you have the power to set the tone for this by giving him a hug or a kiss on the cheek when you first see him. This isn't desperate; it just conveys that you're someone who's warm.

2) Don't sit opposite each other

Sitting opposite one another immediately creates awkwardness. Reason being, when there's a silence, there's nowhere to turn (but facing each other).

If you're sitting adjacent to or next to someone, you can watch the world together. 

Now, when there's a silence, it's not awkward, it's just a silence while you're both looking out to whatever's in front of you. When you're ready to restart the conversation, you can turn to your side and carry on.

3) Do something externally focused

I'm going to say this bluntly: The worse you are at conversation, the more external focus you need. 

If you're an amazing conversationalist, you can take someone to the corner of a quiet bar and talk all night, creating an amazing connection.

If you're someone who's a little nervous, and you know that it takes a while for you to warm up, you have to do something where there's external activity. Examples could be a museum or a comedy show, or on a more subtle level it could be something as simple as taking a walk together.

Even if you were sitting on a busy park bench people-watching, this allows you to comment on things outside of yourselves, as opposed to having the sole focus on the two of you and the conversation you're having.

***

From The Video

It's not an understatement to say I used to spend an enormous amount of energy trying to avoid embarrassing situations.

I would not approach a woman I was interested in because I was worried it might go wrong. I would avoid getting on stage and speaking in front of audiences for fear of looking foolish...

And the problem with avoiding embarrassment is that it prevents you from doing the things you want to do.

We wonder why the people we're attracted to aren't attracted to us - while everyone we're not attracted to swarms us like flies. 

The reason is, when we're in front of the person we're attracted to, we're deathly afraid of embarrassment and this causes us to close down our channels, sensor ourselves, and prevents us from getting across our personalities.

There's a case for embarrassment I want to make to you:

1) People Will Like You More

People like to see the human side of others, and we see the most human side of people when they mess up. The Pratfall Effect is the idea that if you're perceived to be competent at something and you mess up, people will like you more.

2) It Helps You Learn

If you can allow yourself to screw up, it helps you gain the reference points to do something better next time. Failure can help lead to success, and part of failure is going through a little embarrassment here and there.

3) It Liberates You

Allowing yourself to be embarrassed is allowing yourself to get the best out of life. It's freeing yourself up to use your creative channels and experience the greater things life has to offer. The moment you're willing to embarrass yourself is the moment you're completely free.

Question Of The Day:

What positive effects could it have on your life if you gave yourself permission to be whoever you wanted to be?

***

Today I want to talk about the power of metaphors, and how a simple metaphor can change the way you look at a problem.

We become numb to inspirational things because they're around us all of the time.
Someone sent this to me in a text however and immediately it had an impact on me.

""An arrow can only be shot by pulling it backward. When life is dragging you down with difficulties, it means it's going to launch you into something great. So just focus and keep aiming.""

Many of us use certain metaphors for the problems we have:

""Things weighing me down.""
""Stresses on my shoulders.""
""I can't move for all the problems I have.""

People get 'paralysed' by their fears and problems, which stops them from doing anything simply because of the way they look at it.

If you think of the idea of pulling an arrow back before it shoots, the tension in the string gives the arrow its spring and lift -- and you can only get that tension by pulling it back.

I know that so much of the drive I have has come from experiences; the ups and downs my dad went through, going bankrupt one minute having money the next...

All of which made me go into school saying that I was going to conquer the world and that I'd always make sure I built a stable grounding financially in life.

While other people were letting their problems weigh them down, for me it was making that string tighter and tighter so that when eventually I let go, I had a huge amount of momentum behind me.

This is a simple message, but I really want you to take it on board.

I know you have problems right now. They may be work problems, family problems, relationship problems, health problems -- but every one of them can either be used to weigh you down, or can make that rope so taut that when you let it go, you're going to spring into something much greater.

Problems aren't going to disappear, but the way we use them and the momentum they can create can be completely different depending on which metaphor you use.

I hope you can make use of this change in language in your life.

Question Of The Day:

What big problem in your life right now can you turn around with this metaphor?

We're coming up to the end of the year now. I have had the most incredible year of my life. 

So many exciting things have happened, and the realisation I had is that my FAVOURITE thing this year; the thing that I have derived the most enjoyment from is making these videos.

It's the epitome of my passion. I get to talk about what I love, I get to do it the way I want to do it, and I get to put my creative energy into it.

Even with my life now being a little crazy, this is still my favourite thing that I do.

The process of putting these videos out has taught me two things:

1) You don't have to be living an ideal version of your passion in order to enjoy what it is you love doing.

Whatever your passion is, start living it now, even if you only get to live it or 5 minutes a week.

2) ""Ordinary things done consistently produce extraordinary results."" -- Keith Cunningham

There are routines that if you begin in January will change your life if you stick to them and are disciplined, not succumbing to perfectionism with them.

That's what I'm trying to do with these videos - putting something out there every week without fail.

I have people telling me they look forward to these videos every Sunday morning, and now we have a community of people interacting about this stuff.

Thank you for being a part of this and continuing to help me build this incredible group of people. We're a team, I love the relationship we have, and I value every single person who watches these videos.

Question Of The Day:

What one thing are you most proud of that you've done consistently this year? What 'ordinary thing' have you followed through on? (If you can't think of one, write down what you're going to do next year).

Have an amazing Christmas, happy holidays, and I'll see you soon!

This doesn't even sound like a compliment - but it makes him feel like a man, and that's all that matters.

2) ""I love that you make me feel so safe.""

Again, this is a compliment that plays to his masculinity, but in a more serious way. Now he feels like he's strong around you., and will look for opportunities to make you feel safe as a woman.

3) ""You're so great. I feel bad for other women that I got you.""

Immediately he now feels like the most special guy in the room.

If you're with someone, make them feel amazing around you.

When something like this happens, we immediately get resentful, we worry we're not ready, and we start making excuses for ourselves.

If you're not in control of the situation, you have to be ready in the moment.

I made 3 decisions about my focus when this happened.

1) Get Grateful

This is an opportunity - no matter the form it's coming in. It may have come at a time when I didn't know it was going to come; I may not be completely ready for it, but it's a great opportunity and I'm unbelievably grateful to have it.

2) Get Back To Basics

If I communicate from a place of meaningful intention and authenticity, then I can overcome imperfections in the way I communicate. I may not have every answer polished in the exact right way, but if I communicate from my heart and I'm authentic, the audience is going to feel my passion.

3) This Is A Learning Experience

This is a great moment for me to try performing under pressure in ways where I'm not ready for it. I now get to perform in a way that is spontaneous and unanticipated - and I know that there are going to be times in my future where I'm going to have to do this - so I might as well learn now. What better way to learn than in a high stakes environment like this?

One of the greatest ways to change your state in any moment is to change your focus. 

Is what you're focusing on empowering you? Or is what you're focusing on detrimental to your state?

If you determine your focus you'll determine how you'll feel - and of course when you know you can determine how you feel, you can bring a completely different game to any situation.

Here are the videos from that day with Ryan where you can watch me go through this process - going through an interview I really wasn't ready for.

To find out more about Snap2Live, head on over to Ernesto's website http://www.Snap2Live.com.

***

Ernesto is someone who is completely clued-in to building a network of people in a new place, making new friends in an instant, and getting ingratiated into the right parties and social circles (all of which are things that should help massively with the December challenge).

http://www.KissHimAtMidnight.com

Here are Ernesto's mindsets to having a great time and meeting new people.

1) Enjoy life

'My focus is on wanting to enjoy life. I want to make sure that something good comes out of everything I do and everywhere I go. Whether it's having a good time or having an impact and helping someone - I want to make the best of my time.

When I go to places and put myself out there, I'm doing things that I enjoy doing so that at the very leas the people I meet there will have something in common with me.'

2) What's the worst that can happen?

You don't need a support system of friends everywhere you go. You can take the risk and go alone. If you're scared of being by yourself, guess what, if you stay at home you're going to be by yourself as well!

There's a mental barrier that people put in their lives. The truth is, you shouldn't. Just strike up conversation and say something fun. (You can find suggestions here in my December Challenge Guide).

http://www.KissHimAtMidnight.com

Why assume the person you want to speak to isn't a nice person and won't speak with you? Take the chance.

3) Be your BEST self

If you remove agendas and intent, and all you have is two people trying to have a good time, then you're liberated to being the fun, cool version of you.

Socialising and networking is a skill like any other. It's something that you get better at and that becomes more natural the more you do it.

4) Say Yes

This is one of the rules in the guide. The only time you're allowed to say 'No' is if you're double booked. Start taking chances and trying new things.

--Tall order? Big challenge?

Introducing accountability like this changes the way our brains think about what we can do. It forces us to think of new strategies and ways of doing things to guarantee we get the result. 

I put my own brain on this to map out what I'd do if it was my job to make sure you got the guy (or the world would end).

And I've created a little something with all of the ideas I came up with...

The 7 Ways To Guarantee You'll Be Kissing Someone Special On New Year's Eve

Get your free guide now to learn the simple steps:
http://www.KissHimAtMidnight.com

I've literally created a document which details the 7 ways to guarantee this happens, and I want to enrol you in this challenge over the holiday period to get you the result.

It's completely free; the only price of admission is that you making the commitment to really go for it.

It's fun and exciting to take on this kind of a challenge, and a great way to start doing something instead of just watching videos and thinking about dating and relationships all of the time.

884,1YmDcrB1zmw,2013-11-28T08:09:57Z,Why Thanksgiving Makes People Sexier,"Happy Thanksgiving everyone! I've recorded a holiday message for you.

I'm pretty sure you've never associated the holiday with attraction before... But I'm going to show you how the two are linked. 

***

This is by far my favourite American holiday. I like the idea of a holiday that isn't attached to any big ideal or thing; it's just a time to give thanks and get together with the people you love.

This year I've been invited to so many homes, and it's just struck me as a time where everyone is looking to take care of each other. 

It's certainly true that happiness can come from a lot of different things, but I think the pinnacle of happiness comes from being grateful.

-Why Be Grateful

You may not be in the U.S., but I do think the premise of being grateful makes it a useful day for all of us.

You can be thankful for your family, your job, for the time of your life, for what's coming in the future, for experiences you've had...

And it's an important distinction to make that what we're thankful for doesn't have to be the thing that gives us pleasure.

Sometimes we're grateful for the things that bring us pain; an experience, a learning curve, a breakup that taught us something...

There are so many reasons to be grateful that might have nothing to do with pleasure at all.

-Gratitude and Attraction

The more we're thankful for things in our life, the more zest we have for life, the happier we are - and when we're all of those things, we bring a different energy to the room. We impact on people in a completely different way.

Being grateful is completely tied to attraction because it's tied to our energy. 

The #1 reason people become attracted is not looks, it's not because you've ticked every box for character traits they would want; it's the that energy you feel for someone when you're around them.

So my 'assignment' for you today is to...

--Write down 3 things you want to be grateful for - big or small - and feel yourself getting a little happier and 'zestier' about life in the process.

Let me know what they are in the comments below.

And have an amazing day! 

Matt x

You've heard me talk about the two types of people in life: Waiters and Creators. 

Well... there's also a third type of person... 

People who DESTROY.

There's a guy I've been following for a while, George Watsky - a rapper who become a big Youtube name, and who has been in the news recently for jumping off of a very high lighting rig at a show where he injured two people in the process.

He wrote a very sincere apology for his actions which he posted on Facebook:

""The jump was not awesome, it was not badass, and it was not ballsy. It turned what should have been a great day for the people who got hurt into a nightmare. It was stupid and wildly irresponsible, plain and simple.

""Today I let down my supporters, I let down the Warped Tour and I let down my band and the people who work their asses off behind the scenes to make these shows happen. My #1 priority right now is to somehow make this right for the folks who were hurt.

""I am deeply sorry and I promise to learn from this mistake.""

(See full apology here: https://www.facebook.com/gwatsky/posts/10152004824739321)

The apology, despite its sincerity, provoked a HUGE number of comments berating the guy, abusing him, and saying all sorts of nasty things.

What I find more sickening than the newspapers who spread these kinds of stories is the way that they indoctrinate people in general. 

At any time you can go onto a newspaper's website and see people commenting on stories like this in just this way.

I'm always in favour of people disagreeing with me and giving a constructive lesson with an idea that conflicts with mine, but that's very different from what people typically do.

The way people leave these comments is not designed to be productive. Their comments are left with the intention of being sinister and malicious.

The interesting question is: why do people do this?

Why is it that we live in a culture where people have to take 5-10 minutes out of their day to maliciously abuse someone else, when that person has already heard it twenty or more times from other people telling them how stupid they've been? 

Why is it that people feel it necessary to be sinister in this way?

The obvious answer is because these people are lacking something in their own lives.

The same people who leave these comments are distracting themselves from their own productive endeavours.

Do you think each of them doesn't have something they want to do in their life? Something they want to build or create that they haven't got the courage to do.

Maybe they haven't got the drive or strategy. Maybe they have a whole list of excuses as to why they can't do what they want to do. Whatever it is holding them back, the end result is them leaving malicious comments about other people they don't even know, instead of spending their time doing things that would actually benefit their own lives.

I want to speak to these people:

'There is a reason why you took the time to say something and didn't choose to use that time to do something that was actually important to you.

You could have learnt a new word in that time, watched another video that could have educated you on something, or sent a loving text message to someone you do know.

Instead you left a nasty comment.'

***

There are people who wait and people who create in life.

The people I'm talking about don't fall into either one of those categories in a way. They don't wait, they don't create, they destroy.

If from this video one such person is turned to doing something constructive instead of writing a nasty comment next time the opportunity presents itself, then this video and article will at least have done something.

Questions Of The Day:

You may not be a 'troll', but there may be ways you know you waste energy that you know you would rather spend on productive endeavours - even if for 5 minutes.

If you had an extra 5 minutes today, what would you use it for that's important to your life?

886,tvq9MjrpIjM,2013-11-17T18:48:59Z,Nice Guys SHOULD Finish Last... From Matthew Hussey & Get The Guy,"►► Confused about what to text him? Just copy & paste these 9 FREE texts → http://www.9Texts.com

***

You may see me being a little harsh (maybe even a little overly harsh ;) here, but for all of those who consider themselves to be too nice, this is one of those cruel to be kind moments.

***

I have never met someone who is TRULY nice.

I've met people who are honest, who are earnest, I've met people who are generous and kind, but I've never met someone who is 'nice'.

I find that people who say they are 'nice' are using it as a euphemism for being spineless and never rocking the boat.

Not only is that unimaginably boring, but it also means you're dealing with someone who you don't really know.

You don't know what a nice person is really feeling, or what they'd truly like to do.

You ask them for their preference and they don't give you a straight answer. They're not honest about their feelings towards other people, or things that aggravate and annoy them. They just keep things on an even keel the entire time, holding onto the charade of being 'nice'.

As I think about this subject, I think about the film 'The Mask'.

I remember being struck on seeing this film by how much of a nice guy Jim Carey's character Stanley Ipkiss is to begin.

He's known for having finished a piece called 'Nice Guys Finish Last', as he somewhat nobly sees himself as a nice guy (and who in some ways resents the world because of it).

What we find when he puts on the mask is that he becomes a different character.

He becomes bold, edgy, and uncompromising. He becomes a force that drives towards whatever he wants, whether it's women or money, and he goes after what he wants.

Now, he becomes a very unattractive extreme of this, but we know it's a caricature of how he would actually like to be.

He hates when he's a nice guy, and doesn't respect that version of himself. 

I find that nice people don't stay nice forever. They often become bitter or resentful. 

They get angry at the world for being treated badly, and they get angry at themselves for allowing others to walk all over them.

The insidious thing about niceness is that it can actually hurt the people it's intended to please.

In being nice you're not honest with the people you're trying to please, you don't give opinions that people need to hear, you don't cut someone down when they need cutting down... And it can actually end up hurting the people it's intended to help.

The phrase, 'to be cruel to be kind', is a very telling one.

Very often we have to have a sense of cruelty to tell someone something that will benefit them.

I believe KIND people deserve the world. 

Kind people should be given every award, every bit of recognition, and that kind people make the world a better place.

As an extension to idea that 'nice guys finish last', I put to you that nice guys SHOULD finish last.

887,a5_RzEUe2QI,2013-11-10T16:35:16Z,Is Passion Overrated?  From Matthew Hussey & Get The Guy,"(For more on my Retreat programs, click here: http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat/)

Let me tell you why passion is overrated. 

To clarify this: INITIAL passion is what I'm talking about here. 

In my professional life I used to find myself interviewing people who were incredibly passionate about a possible job opportunity in my organisation.

The most passionate people of all would say things like, ""I've always wanted to be a part of something like this"" and ""I'll give it my all, I'll work day and night to make this a success"".

In the beginning I'd think, 'Wow this person really wants it. I'm going to bring this person on board'.

But the problem was that their passion was UNEARNED. 

That person didn't necessarily even know what the day-to-day of their job would be, and very often when things got tough that same person would come back to me to say, ""there's this other thing I'm really passionate about that I have to pursue. I love working with you, but there's this thing I really have to go for.""

They'd get passionate about the next thing that came along in the same unearned way.

Passion when it's unearned tends to be the number one quality of the dabbler.

You see it everywhere. You see people getting crazy exciting about something... and then five minutes later? They're onto the next shiny thing having realised it's not 'perfect', that it does get hard, and that they're not going to enjoy every single minute of the day.

I've learned to be sceptical of initial passion.

I've learned that it's much easier to find someone who can start something that it is to find someone who can finish something. People who can finish things are a lot more rare. 

It takes real passion to be able to finish something; it takes a novelty to start something.

The people who are really passionate about something have a RELATIONSHIP with that thing. 

If they're passionate about a career path, they have a relationship with that career. If they're passionate about a sport, they have a relationship with that sport. If they're passionate about that person, they have a relationship with that person.

This is very different from showing interest in something. A relationship has ups and downs, it's every minute of the day, and it's something that you suffer for.

Passion comes from the Latin verb 'pati', meaning to suffer or endure. 

That's what passion really is. Not doing something for the sake of it or because someone else told you to, but because deep inside you have a relationship with the thing you have to endure.

The number one way women get hurt in relationships is by overvaluing initial passion, instead of valuing investment from a guy.

You know what it's like when a guy comes up to you to tell you that you're the most incredible thing on the plant and that you're 'so beautiful and elegant' and that he 'must spend time with you'. 

When you feel that, you know it's unearned. How could he be so excited about you already? You see this and you're rightly sceptical. 

Carry this mentality into all of your interactions.

Start looking out for those rare moments where you find people who really give over the long-term.

When you find something you really want to do, invest in it over the long-term.

I'm planning more back-to-back live events - in more cities - than I ever have before.

So you can actually SEE what these events are like, I had Jameson, my infamous cameraman come out to Seattle for the final event of this year's tour to cut together this 3-minute trailer clip for you.

And my next round of these events are going to be announced VERY SOON.

At these events I'll be revealing...

-- A three step approach to meeting the hottest guy in any room with ZERO chance of rejection.

-- The REAL reason he didn't call back or is blowing hot and cold (and a 3 step method to get him chasing back after you)

-- A fool-proof technique for guaranteeing a second date with that one guy you really want it to work out with.

And much, much more.

Oh... and the best part?

(Aside from us getting to spend the entire day together!)

To celebrate I have an exclusive offer for the first 500 women who sign up to make this the most affordable live event I've ever run.

We've got the locations just about finalised, and if you're near any major city in the US or Canada (or can get to the UK), I'm probably going to be close.

The gates for tickets will swing open THIS SUNDAY - November 3rd - and we're going to be going live at 2PM Eastern Time.

That's ONLY A FEW DAYS AWAY.

These will be life-changing events to super-charge your love life, learn the exact steps you need to meet your dream guy, and a chance for us to meet in-person.

I genuinely could not be more excited about this. Like everything I do, I'm going to strive to make this exceed your expectations in every way, and I cannot wait to come out and meet you.

Whatever burning questions or issues you have in your love life, this event is your chance to solve it.

I'm going to be taking you inside the male mind, revealing the deep, (sometimes even) dark male psychology that will allow you to meet and attract the man of your dreams quickly, and with almost zero effort.

In coming along you WILL get results. It's as simple as that.

So hang tight and stay tuned.

Because it's coming!

***

When I first came to Los Angeles, I had my first real experience of an American Halloween.

...Interesting isn't it?... What everyone does...

It's everyone just dressing like prostitutes.

I don't even think prostitutes dress like that anymore.

The thing I find strange about it it's the one night of the year when people can dress however they want... and everyone goes as a prostitute. A prostitute something...

A prostitute cat, a prostitute policeman, a prostitute nurse...

I find it very strange.

Go and test yourself. Go and see if you can still be charming, sexy and attractive dressed up as a ketchup bottle - then you'll really know you're sexy.

Anyone can draw attention being slutty - that's easy. I think if you can't be an interesting, charismatic, sexy ketchup bottle you've got bigger problems.

Women say, ""We're doing it for men.""

--What type of men are you doing this for?

""Oh we're doing this because it's what men want.""

--Which men?! Not the men who are looking for a partner. Definitely not. 

Maybe the men that want to shag someone for a night who looks like they're easy to shag.

I agree with women when they talk about how 'piggish' men can be and how objectifying they can be, and how degrading towards women they can be...

I also think that if there's ever confusion created by women over this issue it's on a night like Halloween. 

What are men supposed to do on this night when the rest of the time they're being told they're objectifying women -- and then on this night every woman decides to objectify herself.

It's very weird and confusing!

You can be anything you want to be. ANYTHING you want to be.

==Matt turns into Hussey Potter==

I feel like if we've learned anything in this video it's to be creative. Know what suits you. Know what you can really go as that brings out who you are.

Do it because of who you want to go as. Do it because it's something you want to be for one night - not because other people expect it of you, (not because everyone comments underneath your Youtube videos the entire time that that's who you look like...)

Be who you want to be.

Happy Halloween guys. Stay safe. I'll see you soon.

The goal of a relationship shouldn't be that the person we're with lives up to being on the pedestal we've put them on. The goal should be a connection with who that person REALLY is.

I know that when I first started doing videos on Youtube I was very over-the-top positive.

I had learned growing up that if you want to be an expert - especially in the world of self-help - you have to be happy all the time because that's what influences people and shows you're 'perfect'.

'Self-help = let's all walk around smiling all the time', I thought.

But that's not what it is. And if you're in the mindset, you're missing the point.

People don't have to be one way all of the time. Sometimes you're not supposed to be at a peak level of happiness. 

I like authenticity. I like seeing someone raw and uncut. That to me is where the real excitement is and where you really get to know and learn from someone (not from the polished, media version of them).

In our relationships we're often looking for the 'polished media version' of someone. 

We want our partners to live up to an idea we have of them (a fantasy we've created) - instead of what they really are.

In doing this we end up enforcing all of our own personal rules, not allowing our partner the flexibility to express who they are authentically.

""You either want a relationship with the REAL ME, or you want a relationship with the idea of me.""

I see so many ""gurus"" begin to take themselves so seriously, losing their sense of humour. 

I began changing my Youtube videos from over the top happy to the REAL me (sometimes funny, other times serious, occasionally earnest...). I did this because I didn't want to be seen on some pedestal. 

It doesn't allow you to be human. You create a false perception of who you really are and I never want that to be the case.

I hope you can take the same stance with your relationships.

Stop trying to have a relationship with the IDEA of someone, and instead see them for who they really are.

When you allow yourself to do this, it's far more interesting. 

We get depth, diversity, and a whole range of emotions with someone.

My challenge to you (a challenge I'll be taking up myself), is that when someone does something that doesn't fit with your exact expectation of them, ask yourself whether you want a relationship with the idea of them or with the version of them that actually exists.

The latter will lead to a constant state of conflict any time they do something that goes against the way you think they should be. 

Question of the day...

Have you ever felt people didn't understand the full breadth of your personality? Tell me about it in the comments section below...

This feels like the start of something big.

I love the work I've done in TV. But I also know one of my frustrations with TV is the amount of things you CAN'T say. This radio show is a place where I get to do things my way.

The show is going to be called 'Love Life' - not because it's just about relationships, but about Loving Life in EVERY area. My amazing producers on the show are the same producers that worked to make Ryan Seacrest the huge voice he is today, and they really believe in me...

In fact, so much so that they've allowed me to do this my way. I get to talk about the issues I want to talk about, in both life and love, in a no-holds-barred way that allows my real voice to come across.

No gimmicks, no watered down politically correct rhetoric; just strong, passionate opinions and clearcut life advice. 

I'm REALLY proud of the show and what we've created. There's nothing out there like it, and I'm thrilled for this to be the newest platform to have been added to the GetTheGuy world. 

Whether you are into relationship advice, life advice, or just want to be entertained, this is going to be different to anything else you've heard out there. 

The first episode is launching on October 1st (this Tuesday!) and I can't wait for you to hear it.

To sign up, head over to http://www.iheart.com/talk/show/Love-Life-with-Matt-Hussey/ and create an account.

Have a great Saturday my friends. Here's to a new era (again).

'Be yourself'. Seems like good advice right?

That's what makes this line so insidious.

On the surface we feel it's helpful, but the truth is it rarely serves us.

When someone says 'be yourself' all it does is give us validation for staying the same and not taking risks. 

It's a polite way of saying, 'be who you are now, don't explore being more evolved, advanced, or daring.'

It implies you know who you are, but do you really?

Many of us when asked this look in the rear-view mirror, looking at who we've been in the past.

I don't think that our behaviours and habits are who we are. We should never confuse who we are at our core with the behaviours we've adopted over time.

There are parts of ourselves we won't have experienced in a long time, or that we've never experienced because we haven't pushed ourselves in certain directions.

We find out who we are by having new experiences, adventures, by trying things, figuring out what we like and don't like, and by judging our actions upon reflection.

But we only know all this when we take chances.

If I had followed the advice 'be yourself' I never would have stepped up on stage to start public speaking. I was terrified of it growing up and thought I didn't enjoy it. But once I began to get good at it, I began to adopt it as part of 'me'.

We always have to be questioning who we think we are.

When did you decide you were any one thing? And how do you know it's really true?

Stop trying to sit there 'discovering' who you are, and start DESIGNING who you want to be.

Figure out who you want to be and the goals you want to have. 

--What type of person do you have to be to achieve these goals?

This is a much more practical question than trying to discover who we are.

Are you choosing the route you're choosing because it's really who you are, or are you saying this is who you are to avoid something you're afraid of?

Keep taking risks, mess around with who you are, try new things, and dabble in different ideas and with different personality traits to come to a conclusion yourself from the experiences you have in your life.

I post new dating advice for women every Sunday.

A recent scientific study (...well Marie Claire) showed the two most romantic things you can do for your partner are...

1) Put on a candle-lit dinner. 2) Write a hand-written love note. This got me thinking... 

There are many cliché romantic things we can do for our partners, but I'm a big believer in the most romantic things being unexpectedly romantic.

As such, I've compiled a list of 7 unromantic romantic things you can do for your partner.

By the way, ladies, I would suggest you send this video to the man in your life. 

If you're single, if nothing else, send it on to your uncle, brother, or someone you know whom this will earn huge brownie points for.

They'll thank you later!

1) See the terrible movie your partner really wants to see

When your partner's shown you some awful trailer that they think is great, book the tickets to go see it.

I know you don't want to go. They know you don't want to go, but it's going to mean the world to them that you took the initiative instead of being dragged along kicking and screaming.

2) Surprise them with their favourite lunch

Surprise your partner at their office by taking them their favourite lunch. This will be totally unexpected, and you get extra points if it's a spot that's way out of reach for them during their lunch break. 

3) Run them a bath

Run a nice, warm bath. Get some bubbles going, a few candles and some music... 

Then get the hell out.

The whole point of this one is you're not there. Romantic things don't always have to involve the two of you. You can do something romantic by leaving them to it. This one involves them relaxing and you giving them space.

4) Take their mum out to lunch

Spend some quality time with the person they care about most. 

This doesn't seem romantic as it's not with them at all, but it will go massively appreciated that you're putting in the time and effort with someone they care about.

Treat them well, make it on you, and show them a great time.

5) Wash her car

This is a nice, manly thing to do. Totally out of the blue and she's going to love it.

6) Make her feel like a princess at that time of the month

This might just be the least romantic sounding of all, but there are going to be times where you lady has her 'lady pains'. 

When it gets to that time of the month, you have to think of all of the little things you can do for her in the moment. 

Have a ritual set up. Get her a heating pad, rub her back, put on her favourite Disney movie, and do all of the little things that will 'ambush her with kindness'.

Make her feel like a princess at a time where she's normally used to guys not having a clue how to take care of her.

7) Learn how to make HER cup of tea

Everyone has their own particular way of doing things. 

Learn the subtle intricacies for how your partner likes things done, and it will amplify the effect of you ever doing them. 

Not only are you making her a cup of tea, breakfast in bed, or cooking a fancy dinner, you're doing it the way she's always fantasied about. 

And that's it!

Sometimes the most romantic things you can do are seemingly the most unromantic things you could do. It's these little moments where you really show your partner you're there for them in ways that no one else is.

Anyone can throw together a candle-lit dinner on a first date or write a love note. Here's a list of things that show you know your partner inside out, and that you care deeply for them.

Tired of being single? http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/attract-any-man

***

I'm often getting emails and phone calls from women who tell me that they're 'done with men'.

Women who believe they're going to be alone, single, and the way they are forever.

There is nothing sadder to me than hearing this.

People don't always see relationships as an area relating to potential, but I do.

There is so much potential out there for everyone, and saying this is like handing over your potential.

There is so much opportunity to find out more about who we are, to find out more about people in general and human nature, to share experiences in the world with someone, and to discover life in new ways and grow through the pain of relationships.

Whether they go right or wrong, relationships mean potential.

The reason we sometimes end up in this headspace is because past experiences have followed such a pattern that we don't want to continue with the same cycle.

But we don't have to go through the same cycles again that we've been going through. 

We can go through a different cycle - which can come about through a different mindset, approach or attitude.

In relationships, we have the chance to be who we want to be. 

They're not always going to go right.

Sometimes you'll do everything right, and someone will still do you wrong.

But that doesn't mean we should give up on relationships entirely as a result.

You've given your ALL, and it hasn't worked out. It's not easy to reconcile. But we have to come around to the idea that while our all wasn't right for that scenario, it can be perfect for someone else.

We can simplify this by asking:

--What's the goal?

If our goal is to get it right every time, that's a problem. If that's your mentality, you're going to give up because you'll never win.

The goal has to be...

*I'm going to be the person I want to be in this world.*

Start by being who you want to be, and then filter out the people who don't accept that.

Allow yourself to live up to the standards you've set yourself for how you want to express yourself. 

If someone takes this the wrong way, that's fine, you can move on and look for someone else who will be better suited to them.

We need to chunk it down.

Instead of thinking 'this is going to be my life-partner forever'... 'this is the person I'm going to get married to and have kids with', we have to chunk down.

These things you want are the byproducts of incredible moments with someone.

Getting married is the byproduct of incredible moments that lead two people to a place where they want to get married. 

Having kids is the byproduct of magical moments where you feel a shared intimacy that makes you want something that's greater than the two of you.

We have to look to achieve MOMENTS, not grand visions for how our lives could be with someone in twenty years.

--What are the moments that are going to create the grand vision?

They're moments of shared connection.

Moments like...

-I want to have a smile with someone
-I want to have an unusual conversation over a coffee
-I want to sit at a bar, flirt and have fun

It starts there. The moments are the building blocks. Just focus on bringing your all to the moments.

If you're sitting here reading this thinking, 'I've given up, I can't do this anymore, it's over...' - don't even think about the big vision right now. 

The big vision creates overwhelm and makes us feel like a failure every time we have a false-start.

Think about the moments.

You don't need to take on the burden of 'going out to find a life-partner'. But I do need you to have the courage to say, ""I'm going to go and have a great moment.""

Don't deny yourself connection because one part of you feels that there isn't hope, or that it isn't going to go right.

Instead put your excitement into the moments in front of you that could turn into something magical if you're open enough to let it happen.

What would you tell yourself if you could go back?

These are the 7 things I'd tell my teenage self...

1) Take risks

Try new things. We're always going to be able to talk about the things we did, but never able to talk about the things we didn't do.

We tend to carry on in school the way we started. It's easy for an identity to be created by the way that other people see us. 

2) Be careful who you're trying to impress

There are people right now (whether consciously or unconsciously) you're trying to impress.

Be very careful about this.

If you could see where these people were going to be in ten years time, I guarantee that you would re-evaluate who you're trying to impress right now.

3) Trying to get invited to the party doesn't get you invited to the party

One of my big insecurities in school was wondering whether or not I'd be invited to parties.

Being invited to parties is the byproduct of being the type of person that other people want to spend time with.

Focus on being someone that other people love spending time with.

4) Ignore people's first reactions

When we do something new, we fear people are going to look at us strangely.

People who get acceptance are the ones who don't need it.

If there's something you want to do, do it regardless of what others might think. When you ignore their reactions, you'll get over the initial period of discomfort and to a point where they accept how you now are.

5) School can suck

A lot of school is doing things you don't want to do.

Studying things you don't want to study, hanging around people you don't want to hang around, listening to teachers you don't want to be around...

And a myth in life is that that all changes. That when you begin doing what you love, you'll be able to stop doing things you don't love.

Sadly, it doesn't quite work like that. 

I've found in my life that even though I do the thing I love more than anything else in the world, there are plenty of things I have to do that aren't things I love.

The art is finding a way to enjoy whatever it is you're doing.

When you're doing the things you don't want to do, can you figure out new ways of enjoying doing those things? 

If you can, you're going to be happy for the rest of your life.

6) See everything as a stepping stone

Many people resent jobs they do because they don't feel they're getting them closer to where they want to be.

The most successful people I've met have done a number of different jobs that had nothing to do with where they ended up.

But rather than viewing these things as a waste of time, they saw everything as a stepping stone.

Don't fret that right now you're going into something that isn't exactly where you want to be.

The wrong job before the job you're passionate about can have been the right job at the time.

The wrong job can be a blessing when it teaches you more about what you want and where you want to go.

7) Enjoy being young, but think like an adult

When you're a teenager, people are trying to put all sorts of rules on you.

But just because an adult is treating you like a kid, doesn't mean you have to rebel like a kid.

You can still make the smart choice, by doing what's best for you.

Don't rebel just because you want to get back at someone. 

You need to go out and mess up. Just stay within the realm of making mistakes that you can recover from. 

Make mistakes that aren't going to kill you or stop you from building the future you want to have.

***

So there you have it. My 7 tips.

Leave a comment below to let me know what you think!

And if you're an adult, leave a comment with the one thing you would tell your teenage self that you know would have made life better.

Knowledge is one of the most attractive things we can have.

Sometimes knowledge comes in the form of what we know, other times in the form of things we can do and skills we have.

We live in a world where it's become more necessary than ever to have eclectic knowledge and diverse skillsets. 

Men are running out of ways to feel special. 

It's not enough that they make money or have status, because women today already have these things.

We have to work a little harder to be interesting.

We cannot afford to not be a Renaissance man or woman, with a variety of skillsets, art forms and knowledge bases. 

My challenge to you this week is to go and learn about or study something that you have no real need for. Just something new.

Knowledge and skill is a good look on anyone - as is curiosity which inevitably leads us to these things.

Attraction is sustained for longer periods of time when you're able to keep surprising your partner.

For instance, what if you learned how to make one great meal?

You might have decided already that you're never going to be a fantastic cook, but learning just one meal adds a new dimension to you, and a string to your bow as a person.

You might want to learn to dance, or a new language. And again this isn't necessarily with the hopes of becoming a master in these things, but so that in getting a foot-hold with the skill or ability, you're going to have that much more to talk about when someone brings up the topic.

Give yourself one thing to do this week.

When you have, leave a comment about the thing that's expanded your mind and that makes you a more interesting person for knowing it.

Be sure to leave one as you'll be giving me ideas for what I can go on to do next!

Today I want to converse with you about conversing.

I want to talk about better ways of giving value in conversation than going in and asking mundane questions.

The story I began this video with has been a beautiful way of starting conversations for me this week.

(Please excuse my awful American accent. It's the best I had in me today.)

When I've been introduced to a group of people at a party for instance, I've been able to go in and say, ""Hey guys, you've got to settle this for me. Is this normal?...""

The truth is, the world is made up of really sh*tty conversationalists.

When we go into conversation, too many people sit back waiting for the other people they're with to lead in being a good conversationalist. 

Rather than thinking you have to fall back on a generic set of topics and questions, forget all of that. 

Instead, apply these three steps...

1) Get out of your head

Don't be inside your own head thinking too much. You want to be expressing opinions and talking about the things going on around you.

2) Pay attention

Pay attention to what's happening around you.

--What clothes are people wearing? Is there a pattern to what people are doing? Is it quiet? Is it loud? Is there anything weird happening? 

3) Have opinions

Opinions give other people license to talk and are a great way to evoke responses from other people. Have opinions of things going on around you. They also help get people out of their heads.

Question of the day: Can you remember a great way someone started a conversation with you? What did they do/say?

I was watching an interview with Jerry Seinfeld (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fKVkImeNgo&feature=youtu.be&t=29m25s) the other day and I've become a fan of his because of his work ethic and the way that he thinks.

This is a man who really lives for what he does - he lives for comedy and for telling jokes, and is very passionate about the fact that his life wouldn't be very worthwhile unless he was finding the funny in every situation.

Jerry was asked if his work was still difficult, to which he replied, ""It can be torture, but that's life. Find the torture you can endure.""

We can take this one of two ways; to be depressing or empowering.

I think that one of the great myths of our society is that things get easy.
 
-Get rich quick and your life will be easy...
-Find a relationship and your life will be easy...
-Six-pack abs and your life will be easy...

But life doesn't work like that!

It's not that simple. Life stays difficult.

I see my job as a coach not as helping make people's lives easier, but helping people graduate from doing hard things they hate, to doing hard things they really enjoy.

For me, running GetTheGuy is no easier than it was 5 years ago. More opportunity can mean more work, but I enjoy it more. That's the difference.

The aim isn't to make an easy life. It's to find something you love doing - that is a torture you can endure because it energises you.

Sometimes you'll be doing something hard that you don't find fun, but just because it's not 'fun', doesn't mean it can't be fulfilling. 

As another personal example, I love boxing - not because while I'm doing it I'm having so much 'fun' - but because at the end of it I feel amazing and I get excited about going the next day.

Find a form of torture that you can enjoy that can become part of your DNA and give it everything you've got.

Don't stop because it's hard work or because it's not paying off right now. Keep doing it because you know it's something that drives you at a core level.

Is chivalry dead? It kinda feels that way sometimes -- especially to women...

For guys this is an extremely confusing area.

Women over the last few decades have become pretty damn powerful. They've made great strides in their careers and are now the primary breadwinner in many households.

This creates a lot of double-standards that men are now trying to figure out.

'She earns more than me but does that mean I should still pay on a date?'

'Will giving up my seat be patronising to this woman?'

No matter where you stand on these specific issues...

Women still want men to be men.

And I want to simplify this area today so that we all know how to navigate our way through this maze that is chivalry.

1) Women

Stop complaining about men en masse not being chivalrous. 

There are people out there everywhere who have no manners, who are not polite, but the only thing you have to focus on is demanding a certain standard from the men you choose to keep in your life and spend time with.

The fact that he didn't meet you with that standard doesn't matter if he's willing to take it on and adopt it.

Communicate your standards to guys and give him a chance to live up to them.

2) Men

Start acting right. Stop using excuses about society and how we've changed.

Be good to women. Stop doing this because you think you 'should' and do it because you care.

If you would do it for your mother, do it for every woman (and if you wouldn't do it for your mother, then you really need to learn!).

Everything we do has to come from a core 'why'.

--You love women.

Take this on out of respect for ALL women.

3) Dads

Teach your sons to act right. Don't just tell them to act right around women, show them by the way you treat their mother. 

Be a role model for them to live up to.

4) Mums

Show your sons what you expect as a woman as this will colour his experience with everyone he comes into contact with throughout his life.

Don't roll your eyes and say, ""boys will be boys"" -- that boy is going to be a man some day and the woman in his life is going to pay the price for your shitty standards!

Demand the same level of chivalry you'd expect from any other man in your life.

Send this video on to one person who you know could benefit from it. It could be a guy you know, a member of your family who needs addressing, or a friend you know who is very set in her beliefs on what she expects from a guy.

Question of the day:

What's the one act of chivalry you would like men to perform more?

So last week I did a video on shyness which seems to have hit a bit of a nerve. (http://youtu.be/I6zjZBiMs74)

There were many comments - the majority overwhelmingly good - but also a little bit of controversy which has led me to want to do Part II.

A lot of people were talking about how 'shy' and 'introverted' are not the same thing.

Here's the difference as I see it:

--Introversion is associated with being part of someone's nature.

--Shyness is more derived from insecurity. I feel like it's a polite word for being scared.

If we want to overcome shyness, we have to overcome rejection.

There are two ways to do this:

1) To get accepted and reinforce a different behaviour. 

To see that you can talk to someone and get a positive result.

2) To get more rejection.

More rejection doesn't have to make you more insecure. If you talk to people who have to go through a lot of rejection every day - whether it's cold callers, actors going to auditions, you name it, they'll tell you that they can become desensitised to that rejection.

We have to decide who we want to be - regardless of acceptance or rejection.

If you go into a situation craving acceptance, it feels needy and desperate. Don't worry about it to begin with. Go for rejection. Get rejected as much as possible, because here's what gets you accepted as much as possible...

Being congruent with who you really are.

We need to talk about something...

You don't comment on anything that I do...

You don't say if you like it or not...

You just stand there and watch.

You're not contributing.

I'm sitting here doing my thing and you're what? You're being shy?

It's boring. You being shy is boring.

You're better than that Jameson. Push record. Let's do this.

...

Hi guys,

Matthew here.

I am going to go on a little bit of a rant today...

I want to go on a rant about shyness.

Acting shy is not okay.

Being shy is okay. Acting shy - not okay.

So often people use shyness as an excuse not to contribute.

To give one word answers, not to laugh at jokes, not to give their opinions on something...

A common trait of people who are shy is that they think that everyone else is aware of their shyness. Rarely do they stop and think that other people don't think that they're shy. They think you're not interested, that you're cold, or that you're just boring and have nothing to say.

I think 'shy' is a pleasant term for being scared.

People say, 'well that's not true, I'm an introvert'.

Even if you're shy, or would label yourself an introvert, never use this as an excuse not to cultivate the skills of the extrovert.

I know so many introverts - like myself - who make being an introvert into this noble, glorified thing.

If we want to be the most well-rounded, charismatic person that we can be, sometimes we have to cultivate the skills of the extrovert.

It doesn't mean that you have to live in 'extrovert mode' 24 hours a day, but it does mean that you have to be able to bring out those skills when you need them.

When I step on stage, I'm bringing out the skills of the extrovert, even though that's not who I am naturally.

You can be an introvert and enjoy being an extrovert on certain evenings and occasions, and then go back to being an introvert.

It's fun to be able to do both.

Never let someone convince you that being an introvert stops you from being able to bring out the extrovert just for the hell of it.

I already know what's going to happen on this video...

People are going to comment that, 'he's clearly an extrovert, I love this coming from him...'.

I was a COMPLETE introvert. I couldn't even talk to a girl that I liked.

Being able to develop those skills was one of the biggest gifts I gave myself because now I'm able to go into situations that scare me, and in spite of that fear, I'm able to bring out parts of my personality that when I'm younger I never used to be able to bring out.

Being shy is okay. Acting shy - not okay.

'Matt you're being so harsh in this video. Why did you turn so mean all of a sudden?'

--Is it okay to sometimes be shy?

Yes of course. It's fine.

The point is that being that way all the time and using it as an excuse to never not be shy is not good.

Not good for your life, not good for your interactions, for your strength of character and how diverse and interesting you can be.

You're more than shy.

That's how life is. It's never as black and white as people like to label it.

So don't be labelled. Be what you want to be in any given moment.

Do what works. Not what you 'think' you are.

--You get that Jameson? That goes for you too.

I'll see you soon guys.

So I'm here in America right now. Evidently on this day that is today, American's celebrate a holiday, July 4th.

You don't hear a lot about July 4th in England. If you lose a fight, that's not a fight you talk about down the pub on a Sunday. You keep that one out of the conversation.

I'm here now and Americans are going nuts over this holiday and I'm really for it.

I'm really happy for America today.

So much so that I actually went out of my way to make Jameson a cup of English tea!

Given the nature of today, I thought it would be appropriate to do a video on 'how to get over an argument that you've had'.

We all go through arguments in relationships, and we don't necessarily know how to repair things afterwards. 

--How can we fix the damage that's been done?

Well... we don't do it by continuing the feud. We do it through better communication. 

There are two things going on in any argument: Rules and Standards.

STANDARDS are the fundamentals for what you will and won't accept in a relationship. In other words, the level of lovingness, generosity, care, nurturing and excitement that you hold someone to.

Really that forms the type of relationship you want to have at its core.

RULES are the surface level ways we use to determine whether someone is meeting our standards.

Examples:

'I have a rule that someone has to get home by a certain time in order to show that they love me and spend time with me.'

'I have a rule that someone has to text me a certain number of times to show the level of thoughtfulness that I'm looking for.'

The difference between Rules and Standards is that Standards are important at their core because they reveal intent and values. 

Rules are things that we ourselves make up. They are a meaning that we attribute to things. We're not always right in the meaning that we attribute to things, and sometimes our rules are crazy and out of proportion, or just in the wrong context.

If someone is breaking your rule, you have a decision to make. 

--Do I want to change this rule? Is it relevant in this particular moment?

Many times you'll decide that the rule is not as important as the relationship itself, and that you have a level of love and care and connection that allows you to get bigger than the rule and not make it so important.

If someone fundamentally violates your standard, that's a different story.

Most people get angry, upset and emotion when their standards are violated, and they don't know how to vent that, so they stop communicating and continue arguing.

What we have to do is learn to communicate.

The best way to do so is to start in a positive way.

'I love you. I care for you. I want to be close to you. But right now, with what you're doing - with the way you're violating my standard - I can't be close to you.'

'As much as I want it to, this can't work unless you're able to change this part of you.'

That way you give someone the space to go away and to improve and surprise you. If they have the potential, give them the chance to reach that potential. Not forever - but enough of a chance to change.

If they can't reach that potential, we have to be brave enough to separate ourselves from them so that we can go and include more people in our lives who will.

You're either going to have someone who stays, and who you keep around because they CAN meet your standards, or you're going to lose someone who can't meet your standards.

You'll either keep someone who's right for you, or you'll lose someone who's wrong for you.

Life really can be as simple as that, even if it's painful at times.

--Happy Independence Day!

I received something in the post today that I'm crazy-excited about...

It's a bracelet that on one side says, ""Wait?""...

And on the other says, ""Create"".

--Do I want to Wait or for what I want, or do I want to go out and Create it?

I've gotten these wristbands made up for people who are coming on my Lifestyle Retreat (http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat-flr/).

The idea for the wristband is that it contains a mantra that people could use to always be a trigger for action.

So often when people say, ""I don't know what to do"", it's really a euphemism for saying, 'I'm scared of the thing I SHOULD do'.

Remember: Life isn't easy, but it doesn't have to be complex.

It can be as simple as the choice to either Wait or Create.

--Not good at flirting? Go out and create new ways of flirting; use different words, stand differently, move differently, use a different tempo with your voice...

John Ruskin, an English writer said that ""Quality is never an accident. It is always the result of intelligent effort.""

Now I'm here to tell that you don't always start with 'intelligent effort'. Ruskin was right - quality does always come from intelligent effort - but you don't always know what 'intelligent effort' is in the beginning! 

Sometimes it starts with just 'effort'.

What I want to know when people come on my Retreat programme (http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat-flr/) is that any time they're feeling apathetic, frustrated, indecisive, lazy or scared... I want them to look down at this thing and remember these two options.

WAIT or CREATE.

It's that simple.

--Which person do I want to be?

I went through a period in my life recently during which I was 'waiting' too much, as I had lost motivation in a certain way.

I had always been driven by fear; fear of not surviving, for not having enough money to support myself or my family, and in recent times, we've all been okay. 

Everyone is taken care of and we have everything we need. And so all of a sudden in coming into this, I had lost the initial motivation that drove me.

Let me tell you something ironic. When these wristbands came through, I got excited again. I got excited because I realised my new drivers: Quality, creating new solutions, and being creative.

My whole motivation has now changed.

In creating these little wristbands, I've given way to a whole new set of emotions.

It doesn't take big actions to create big emotions. A small act of creation can change your entire world.

When you create in a certain way, you respect yourself more. You stimulate new ways of thinking, and you start to get momentum, creating layer upon layer of success.

I don't have these wristbands for everyone right now, they're just for people coming on the Retreat (http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat-flr/), but I want you to find your own way of triggering the message to ask, 'How am I going to do this in my life right now?'.

--Am I going to be a Waiter or a Creator?

And for you to be asking this of yourself in any given moment.

So it was my birthday this week...

In a way it's bittersweet. 

We think about the fact that it's our birthday and a really special day, but at the same time we can't help but think about all of the things we wished we'd done by this point.

What's struck me this year is that my birthday marks the halfway point of the year; - my birthday comes in at 'halftime'.

In sport, at halftime, the coach takes the team into the locker room and gives them a pep talk. This is different from the talk they would have gotten going into the first half of the game.

When starting out, you think about the results that you want out of the year and what you want to take on as new habits.

You ask...

--Why is this year going to be better than last?

Now it's halftime, the pep talk you're getting is now based on what's already happened during the first part of 'the game'.

I know I've been a little frustrated at myself at there being a few things I've wanted to get done that I haven't gotten to...

There are certain projects that I still haven't been able to start, and perhaps I've been overly ambitious with a few things...

When you look back and ask yourself if you've achieved half of the things that you set out to achieve, it's easy to look at the second half of the year with the urge to want to write it off before you've even begun.

Here's the thing... at the end of June, there are 6 months left...

--184 days of your life to play with.

184 days to be productive, to be efficient, to go out and love, to have adventure, to do new things, to build an amazing life...

This is all time we have right now in the palms of our hands.

If we focus on the frustration from not having achieved what we wanted to have achieved during the first half of the year, we're never likely to achieve what we have the potential to achieve during the second half of the year.

To combat this, I've looked at three big areas of focus that will really help me in making the next 6 months into what I want them to be. I hope they will serve you in doing likewise...

1) Know your weaknesses

The biggest weaknesses that I need to combat are:

Distraction, the feeling of overwhelm, losing touch with those I love, not sticking to daily habits, and not re-focusing on goals every day.

The things I've been able to achieve in life have only been possible through having an awareness of the weaknesses I have - and in actively seeking to combat them. 

Things start to go wrong when we don't bring awareness to our areas of weakness, and in bringing attention to them, we're able to see the pitfalls we would otherwise go down and adjust course to avoid them.

2) Know what drives you

One of the biggest drains of motivation is that we lose connection with the reasons we go after things in life.

Everyone has had a day where they felt particularly motivated, and it wasn't that they were a different person that day, it was that their focus was in a different area.

They were thinking about something that drove them in an extraordinary way, and that made them go out and achieve.

--How can you bring this kind of focus into your daily life for the next 6 months?

3) Renew your goals

The need we feel to create new things often leads us to moving onto the next set of goals without having rounded off the first.

I recently heard someone say that...

""It's better to go back to old resolutions than to keep creating new ones.""

And I think this is so true.

Coming up with new goals gives us the feeling that we're being creative and that we're evolving, when sometimes the biggest way we can move forward is taking a step back to a goal that we knew would make us happy, but that until now we'd lost focus with.

--What goals have you lost touch with?

...

If we really go for it, we can make magic happen in the next 6 months.

This can really be the most incredible year of our lives.

I hope you're excited. Here's to the rest of the year!

The lesson of this video is to become a VALUE GIVER, not a value taker.

While my book and organisation are playfully called ""Get The Guy"", you really don't 'get' by going out with a mindset to get. You get by going out with a mindset to GIVE.

Think about it... You KNOW when a guy's not coming up to you to give value; when he's coming up to you just try and get something.

In the example I talk about in the video, it struck me that this is exactly how women feel when a guy walks up to them with an agenda. 

And so many people go into interactions with a transaction in mind.

Today I want to pose a simple question:

--How do you add value? 

Through your personality? Your humour? Who you are? The atmosphere you create?

As I mention in the video, you don't have to go in thinking 'I am going to give value to this person'. You can add value just by being a great energy around someone.

How are you going to do it with the next group you come into contact with?

***

Many of you have been asking about the Lifestyle Retreat programs that I do. 

Both events that I had booked for the end of this year and now completely SOLD OUT - even though there's still over 4 months to go!

**Great news**... I've decided to throw in one more just to cope with demand and the number of people who otherwise would be missing out.

Check it out here: http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat-flr/

This is something I'd never normally do, but there are simply too many people missing out to not do it.

It's going to be in November from the 4th to the 8th.

I would love to see you there!

See the blog post: http://gettheguy.co.uk/blog/highlight-reel/

(Be sure to watch right to the end or you'll miss the whole joke!)

While I've shot this in a fun way, there is a big takeaway I want to leave you with:

Life can be monotonous

Most people's lives aren't that interesting hour by hour, minute by minute.

However Facebook and other social media outlets have created a place for people to share only the most exciting parts of their lives.

This can lead us to thinking that our life pales in comparison to what others are doing (leaving us feel terrible).

There's a quote that sums this up beautifully that I've become obsessed with...

""Don't compare your behind the scenes to somebody else's highlight reel.""

Looking at everyone else's highlight reel through the lens of social media is demoralising and depressing.

The truth is, most people's lives day-to-day are incredibly monotonous, and when you're on a mission and trying to achieve something, it often requires you do the same things every day. 

I don't want us to become demoralised, and so I shot the video above to bring you back to reality and show how exciting my life really is.

We have to realise that social media is a facade, and that when we can stop comparing our lives to the highlight reels of others, we'll be able to get more out of our own lives and enjoy our own day to day much more.

Once we see through this veneer, we have the ability to really focus on our own exciting adventure.

Question of the day: 

What's the most boring thing you do every day to keep things improving? Let me know in the comments below!

If you are confident at your core, nothing else matters.

So many of us rely on external trappings to feel confident. For some of us it's our car or our house, for others it's our job. 

The danger in deriving our confidence from these things however is that it could all be taken away from us tomorrow.

We need to find a way of gaining confidence that can never leave us.

We are the greatest asset we'll ever have.

We are the thing that we should feel confident about.

The line that summed this up for me in the film was this:

""My suit wasn't a hobby, it wasn't a distraction, it was a cocoon. You could take away my tricks, you could take away my toys, you could take away my house, but there's one thing you can't take away... I AM Ironman.""

In life, never take at face value how confident people seem.

Most people who seem confident are really just basing their worth on things that could be taken away.

--How many people do you know who could stand strong in the knowledge that they are their greatest asset?

I told you in a recent video the story of having to face up to this myself with the show - something I'd worked on for over year - being taken off the air. 

I had to step up and say to myself, you can take away the show, you can take away everything that came with it... but so long as I have my voice and I can do my thing, I'm the asset.

It doesn't matter what gets taken away. The thing that gives you real confidence is who you are at your core.

Don't base your confidence on what you're achieving. Build your confidence in such a way that if you were to lose everything, you could still feel amazing.

If you want to learn how to do this, I have a program that could be for you.

This has been one of the big, passionate subjects of my entire career. It's something that I consider to be more important than anything else, and something that I've built an entire program around the concept of.

If you want to learn how to develop real core confidence and how to be invincible wherever you are in life, then this might be for you.

The program is the High Value Retreat and I have two set for the rest of the year and that's it.

http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat/

The first is in Clearwater Florida in September, the second in Palm Springs in December.

http://www.gettheguy.co.uk/lifestyle-retreat/

You have to apply, and if you'd like to do so or find out more about the process, you can here. There's a video where I cover all of the event details and a chance to enquire about the application process.

Check it out, and who knows, we could be spending 5 days together this year...

I think we can all learn a thing or two from Gatsby.

If you've read the book or you've seen the film, then you know that Gatsby threw these crazy, opulent parties where hundreds of people poured through the doors.

1) Why throw parties

If you're the person throwing the party, everyone knows you.

The person throwing a party is someone we call a 'hub'.

You become everyone's common point of conversation. You're the favourite topic of everyone there. Everyone gets to know you better, even if you're not in the room, because they talk.

The great thing about being a 'connector' of course is that by putting people together, people want to help you and do you favours. You become important that way.

2) An alternative to becoming a 'hub'

You don't have to be the one throwing the party all of the time.

You don't have to be a hub. What you do need to be however - if you're not going to be the hub - is someone who knows a hub.

If you know the person throwing the party, you always have a way to go and meet people.

You can use this person as a gateway to meeting more and more new people.

3) Have an emotional vision for life

One of the things we know about Gatsby is that through all of his achievement, he had an extremely emotional vision of where he was going.

I'm always coaching is that in order to get somewhere, you can't be driven by logic.

Logic doesn't last. Logic leads you to running on will-power and will-power never lasts.

You have to run on emotion. You have to find something that drives you on a visceral, gut level.

For Gatsby it was a woman. It was the ideal he had in his head - and of course that become an unhealthy ideal because it became unrealistic - but he had something driving him that was bigger than an amount of money or the size of a house. It was a VISION of his life with somebody.

We all have to find that emotional vision that's going to drive us through all of the hard times.

4) Believe you're destined for greatness

Gatsby believed that he was destined for greatness, even as a boy. 

We all have to believe on some level that we're destined for great things.

What makes YOU special?

We all have to believe that we're special in our own way.

5) Have a plan

Gatsby had a way of constantly improving himself and saw himself as his greatest asset.

(In the book) His dad found a journal with his daily diary.

Schedule Sept 12th 1906

Rise from bed - 6:00 AM
Dumbbell exercise and wall scaling - 6:15 - 6:30 AM
Study electricity etc. - 7:15 - 8:15 AM
Work - 8:30 - 4:30 PM 
Basketball and sports - 4:30 - 5:00 PM
Practice elocution, poise and how to obtain it - 5:00 - 6:00 PM
Study needed inventions - 7:00 - 9:00 PM

General Resolves

--No wasting time at Shafters
--No more smoking or chewing
--Bath every other day
--Read one improving book or magazine a week
--Save ($5.00 - crossed out) $3.00 a week
--Be better to parents

Have things that act as a compass for how you live.

If you're thinking about this and what you want to achieve when you wake up, it's already too late.

This has to done the night before so that when you wake up, you're straight into action and know exactly where you want to be.

***

Now Gatsby had his flaws. But I feel like we can all learn something, even from flawed men.

When we take his best parts and combine them with the learnings and what we see from afar, that's when we'll achieve our own form of greatness.","['The Great Gatsby (Book)', 'the great gatsby', 'the great gatsby (film)', 'the great gatsby (movie)', 'matthew hussey', 'get the guy', 'ready for love']",PT4M34S,hd,false,193629,2909,174

I have so much I want to catch you up on. It's been a little while since I've been able to do something on Youtube, but I'm back!

In the last two weeks I had two pieces of pretty (well...very) shocking news, and I wanted to share it with you in this video. 

One of these pieces of news was AMAZING, the other was MORTIFYING. I talk about it all in the video. 

It contains a really important lesson I don't want you to miss.

Most dating books tell you what NOT to do. Here's a book dedicated to telling you what you CAN do.

In his book, Get the Guy, Matthew Hussey—relationship expert, matchmaker, and star of the reality show Ready for Love—reveals the secrets of the male mind and the fundamentals of dating and mating for a proven, revolutionary approach to help women to find lasting love.

Matthew Hussey has coached thousands of high-powered CEOs, showing them how to develop confidence and build relationships that translate into professional success. Many of Matthew's male clients pressed him for advice on how to apply his winning strategies not to just get the job, but how to get the girl. As his reputation grew, Hussey was approached by more and more women, eager to hear what he had learned about the male perspective on love and romance.

From landing a first date to establishing emotional intimacy, playful flirtation to red-hot bedroom tips, Matthew's insightfulness, irreverence, and warmth makes Get the Guy: Learn Secrets of the Male Mind to Find the Man You Want and the Love You Deserve a one-of-a-kind relationship guide and the handbook for every woman who wants to get the guy she's been waiting for.

Attraction is something that can be learned; it's not something set in stone.

There's a myth that we're either attractive or we're not -- or that someone can either be attracted to us or not.

In reality, I've found that life's not so simple. It's not that black and white.

Have you ever become attracted to someone who wasn't your type?

That's because attraction has a formula. There's a science to it, which is what I want to go through with you today. I want you to come to believe that attraction is possible to influence.

You can have someone who is constantly attractive in one environment, and you can put them in another environment and they're not.

Have you ever gone out and felt that you were getting so much attention one night, but the next you didn't get any?

This didn't happen because you looked so different on each of the two nights. There are things you can do to change and improve your appearance of course, but there are other factors at play.

Here is the formula you need to know for creating deep and lasting attraction...

1) Visual Chemistry

People think this is just about how you look -- and it's not true. It's about how you're perceived.

It's about how you walk, talk, move, what your body language conveys -- and there's a lot we can do in each of these to influence how attractive we are perceived to be.

2) Perceived Challenge

This is what people are really talking about when they talk about the idea of 'playing hard to get'.

Men want to feel that they are earning you every step of the way. They want to feel that you're attainable, but there are steps they have to go through to earn your attraction.

3) Perceived Value

Perceived value is what you have about you that is really worth something. This might be to do with personality traits that you have, the lifestyle you have -- something that makes a guy think to himself, 'this woman has value to add to my life'.

4) Connection

Connection is when the two of you truly feel like you relate. This comes mostly from understanding.

--'Do I feel understood by this person? And do I understand them?'
--'Do our beliefs, ideas and ways of thinking relate?'

This is what creates connection. And notice that you can have all of the first three components without any connection. That's why connection is such a vital piece in the formula.

Hey everyone!

I wanted to give you a little something from my tour so far, so that wherever you are in the world you can get a taste of what's happening all around America right now.

http://howtogettheguy.com/tour/

As I'm sure you know by now, in celebration of my new book GetTheGuy, and my new show on NBC 'Ready For Love', I'm going to 10 major USA cities to help women across America find love.

This video was taken from a question and answer session at my LA event (the first stop on the tour). I still have 9 more stops to go, and there is still time to get tickets.
---http://howtogettheguy.com/tour/

I hope you enjoy the video. You'll see me answering questions asked live by the audience. Amongst the questions I answer are:

-How do I deal with it when a guy is blowing hot and cold?

-What if I shut down with new guys because I've been hurt in the past?

-Is it ok to date multiple men at the same time?

-How do I figure out if he has a girlfriend or not when I first meet him?

-What should I do if I keep attracting the wrong men?

Enjoy!

Matthew x

I made this video from my bedroom balcony on my Retreat on Clearwater beach.

It's day two of the program right now, three more to go! The changes so far have already been beautiful to watch. We had a woman who was so terrified of public speaking that she broke down in tears at the thought of it. 

Within the space of 5 minutes she was on stage giving a speech. There were literally gasps in the room followed by huge applause at how quickly she went from tears to confidence. 

And that was just the second day!

In aid of this moment I decided to make a spontaneous video about stage fright. The cool part about it is that it can be used in situations with men that normally make you nervous too.

We've had so many emails in recently from people asking me to do a few videos for people in relationships.

If you're seeing a guy or you're in a relationship right now, I want to share something that can make your relationship even more special.

Today's tip revolves around arguments...

Arguments are always seen as negative, and people often assume that in the early stages of a relationship arguments are a sign of things coming to an end.

Let's imagine for a second that you're with your guy and the two of you start arguing.
Immediately emotion comes in that says, ""I need to win this argument"". This might be caused by pride, stubbornness and insecurity, and today I want to make sure that we argue from a more mature place (I've been guilty of this wanting to 'win' myself, which is why I know the topic so well!).

Remember that there's a difference between winning in an argument, and winning in a relationship.

I want to make sure that you win in the relationship.

The argument is just a battle; the relationship is the war.

Next time you're in an argument, there are two words that I want you to remember:

I Understand

Sounds obvious -- the key to relationships is understanding. But it's true. When you get to the head of an argument, showing that you understand someone is THE KEY.

You might not agree with someone's reaction to a situation, but you can acknowledge where their feelings have come from that have lead to their reaction.

Imagine that you've done something that's caused him to feel jealous and to come over and shout at you. You're annoyed because you feel like he had no right to start shouting at you.

Now, you can disagree with his reaction to shout at you, but try to understand and acknowledge the feeling that the shouting came from.

When you're empathetic and understand the feeling, people will very often show that they're sorry and you'll diffuse an argument.

I want to make our default response to someone's anger to try and figure out why someone is feeling a certain way before you retaliate. Going on the attack is where you can do serious damage to a relationship.

You're a team, you want to help each other, and the easiest way to do that is to show that you understand.

Question of the day

I read an article on the Huffington Post - http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/01/31/arguing-key-to-happy-relationship_n_1243503.html -  recently that couples that argue once a week stand a better chance of staying together. 

Do you agree with this? Can arguments be a good thing?

Let me know in the comments below. I read every single one, and I'm going to do my best to reply.
