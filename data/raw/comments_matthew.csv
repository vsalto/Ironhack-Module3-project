She ends almost all her videos saying ""always trust your instincts."" She campaigns avidly for reform around domestic abuse and other related issues such as stalking laws etc. She was one of the main campaigners who got the coercive control law passed in the UK and she devised the police DASH system for logging and rating domestic abuse incidents. It creates complications when someone with so much expertise says to always trust your instincts. And then a life coach - who\'s also at the top of their game - challenges that and breaks it down. It would be great to have a video or situation where these two perspectives could be discussed and broken down.', ""there's a huge difference:\n*my instinctive response is not my intuition.*\nmy instinctive response is emotions going high and that puts me at risk to act on that. So it's best to calm down first or to even let a few days pass.\nmy intuition is sth deep down, calm and safe, and i can easily trust it and it has never failed me."", ""I think it's also worthy to distinguish between intuition and instinct. So for instance, sensing that someone is not trustworthy might be more of an intuition. The way we react in a circumstance is more of an instinct. I would trust more my intuition than my instinct, although controlling instincts too much can also be detrimental. For instance, if your child is being a brat, your instinct may be to get angry and shout a bit, but you control yourself based on learned ideas, on your head, because you think you should not be violent at all. And then this may cause you more problems, because the child may learn much quicker to behave well if exposed to your natural reaction, but your rationality keeps them misbehaving and getting you more unconsciously angry and then acting out your anger in more subtle and destructive ways :)"", ""You made me realize that my instinct is to repair it all by myself. As a child raised by a single mother of 2, with financial issues and stress, what I've learned is that no one will help me solve my problems or help me get what I need. So now in a trauma bond relationship I find myself trying to fix things all the time, even when he's the one breaking it and he's just leaning back or even going away and just demanding. This is the instinct that does not serve me anymore.

We spoke or saw each other about every day for 5 weeks. \n\nI was crazy about her. And i could see she was happy with me, and she was actually the one to make all these future plans and goals. I was so happy that this beautiful girl that i knew from so long ago wanted something long term with me. And since she was making these plans i felt safe that she wasn\'t going anywhere.\n\nEvery time we hung out we always had fun. All laughs and smiles. I thought i finally found the one. \n\nWhat\'s more is my career plan is going into real estate, and at that time she was actually going for her real estate license. There was such amazing future potential. I found myself asking myself if i was really in love with her and if this was meant to be.\n\nWell, one day we\'re coming back from the store together. And everything is fine.. and i forget how it came up, but at some point i just teased her a little for not having seen a popular movie. She suddenly got defensive, causing me to get defensive and it was the first time we had gotten upset/annoyed with each other. \n\n\nWell i didn\'t think much of it at first. Figured this is normal and would\'ve happened eventually. But i apologize anyway to try and smooth things over. But she would then ghost me for a week. And when i finally heard back a week later, all i got was ""im just not interested anymore"" and ""there\'s multiple reasons things won\'t work"".\n\nNo explanation beyond that. That absolutely crushed me. Not just losing her, but also not knowing why. \n\nI tried staying strong and keeping myself from begging and everything for a couple months. Then i try and talk to her 2 months later, and she said the reason she thought it wont work was because of religion. She\'s Muslim and I\'m Christian. That\'s the first i heard of it being an issue.\n\nI thought knowing why would help, but it just made it worse cause now i felt like i had no chance and there\'s nothing within my power i could do.\n\nWell its been 4 months since we last spoke. And I\'ve been trying to improve myself. Waking up earlier, working out alot, and even took the time to learn about her religion. I had hoped learning about it might resolve the issue. So I\'ve been wanting to speak with her about it. \n\nBut i literally just found out from my neighbor she\'s seeing someone else. This is where I\'m at now. And it\'s like a dagger right to the wound that was in the process of healing. \n\nTo make matters worse, I\'m reminded every single day of her. I can see her car from my house. Every street around town reminds me of her, things in my house i bought when with her. I just can\'t escape it.\n\nI never knew such a short time with someone could cause this much heartache. She meant so much more to me than just some girl that i tried dating. Things made perfect sense, there was all the potential in the world, we were both happy and wanted the same things. It\'s been so hard to get over her.

Where you have a difficult time controlling your thoughts, any way. \n\nHOW do you stop thinking about it every second, or feeling like you're physically bleeding inside, or stop replaying every second of every event and every word and every action of it all.... \nOr worrying about why they don't seem to even care, in spite of the fact that we both put our time, effort and affection into this thing for such a long time...\nI just don't know how to stop? I feel like I cannot control my own mind or my body's responses to it.\nAnd it's simply becoming too much to bear or handle. \nSo I figured I'd just ask. Even knowing I may get a negative response for this. \nThanks."", '💛', ""I don't think its right to start with labeling someone as a cheater without looking at the reasons behind the behavior - and then, depending on the individual situation, decide to proceed with them or not. \n\nI have a close relationship with a Methodist Pastor - he is married to a cousin of mine. We've had a lot of conversations over the years and he said something I thought was interesting in relation to this topic. He said he has counseled many people individually and couples and said that most people who cheat are seeking emotional connection and validation that they are no longer getting from their spouse. He said that he usually gets both sides seeing the couple together, and this proves to be true; especially in long marriages. \n\nNow sure, there ARE serial cheaters who may or may not be sex addicts. Those people need help beyond a Pastor and in those cases of a probable true addiction issue, my cousin in law will refer them to a licensed therapist. That is an individual issue, not due to any relationship issue with their spouse. \n\nSo...I'd say we have to know the reason for the behavior before deciding if it can be fixed, and by whom. Is it a couple issue where both partners contributed in some way? Or is it mostly or solely due to something within the individual who cheated? I think its important to address this. \n\nAnd again, did this happen while they were committed to you, or was this in their past? And what was their reason, and what did, or what are they doing about it? Is accountability there? Its so individual that I don't think it is a subject or behavior where you can lump everyone who has cheated into one box and label them all the same way."", ""When you are over 50 it is a perfectly good time to ask why someone's relationship ended on a phone vetting conversation before even going on a date. Sorry, you are just wasting people's time at this age if you can't be upfront from the very beginning."", 'I appreciate the level of maturity and open honest conversation. It’s very interesting to watch everyone in the comments being so critical. When I can guarantee you at least half or more of them have cheated or been cheated on and a majority of them either stay or so they’re all here just Speaking from a place that doesn’t even exist. That’s not even true for whatever delusion they are living in. I have been cheated on and I have personally cheated myself. I am not a cheater, but I did put myself in a compromising position as I was out drinking with friends one night and it was not intentional. All I know is I had four shots of tequila and the next thing I know I am in a hotel room. I don’t even know how I got home. At the time I had just started, dating my boyfriend of three months and I can’t tell you the level of guilt and shame that I carried and I was a weasel. I never told him. I couldn’t. But when I tell you, I never want to fill that fill again because it absolutely tore my heart, my mind my soul up every single day. That is something I never want to experience again, and that was a lesson enough for me to never do that again. Not even put myself in a compromising position. And I’m not some alcoholic. I was not some party girl. It just happened on a whim. Went out socially with some girlfriends. It was not an affair. I was not looking to cheat. I just put myself in a comfortable position. And to this day, I do not touch alcohol. That is how much I learned my lesson. So it’s absolutely not true once a cheater, always a cheater. I think exactly the conversation you guys are having it depends on the level of guilt and shame. Someone carried anyone with a heart for what you did to someone else it’s gonna fucking eat you alive and that should be enough to learn your lesson and never do it again like it did me.I fucked up, but I made up for a lot of work on myself. I promise it will never happen again because I can’t fathom carrying that burden once more. Not a fun place to be.', 'Thank you for your wise words, Matthew!']"

However…\nThe constant dating advice I am  hearing is “be in the moment but don’t get over excited & question everything.”\nNow, it’s fair and solid advice. But I feel as though we have become so overly cautious and analytical over our dating experience as a society that the fun is sucked out if it all and we cannot simply relax into the experience and enjoy it for what it is. The constant thought of “when is the rubber band going g to snap?” Keeps looming over our heads to the point that even the positive things that someone does (I.e. show investment in a relational dynamic such as planning dates, gift giving etc) is seen as a negative. Over giving is also seen as a “red flag” even if it’s months into seeing someone?\nSo how do we discern what’s true and what’s not? 🤷🏼\u200d♀️\nAgain, we are constantly waiting for the show to drop. All this messaging around being cautious and not accepting things for what they are is confusing and makes people (women) pull back because there’s no knowing a persons (man) true intentions whether it be 1 month of one year into a relationship. \nUltimately only we can trust ourselves and the choices we make. We have no control over what others do. But we have conditioned ourselves to question everything to the point where it’s hard to trust anyone else even if they are showing up with green flags. And that in itself causes us to act in ways that keep people at arms length even though we truly want to go all in. It stops us from fully embracing love and life be us we are constantly buffering ourselves from the reality that at any given moment this person could flip the switch on us. Living in a perpetual state of angst is not a good way to live despite our good intentions and that of the other which appears visible to us. \nOverall I love the advice but I feel a lot of people walk alway with this thinking.. “Ok, so be present, give it your all but don’t expect anything good to come out of it in the end coz you just never know..”\n😕', ""This is why I'm scared to date.

This was on Mother’s Day. \n\nI really had no identity outside of my life with him. I truly lived for him and let him control every part of my life and when this happened, I genuinely thought I was going to die of heartbreak, the pain was so immense. Starting a new life for myself, moving into my own house, buying my own vehicle, literally at 31 years old, experiencing independence and figuring out LIFE on my own and alone, with two kids, was hard. I didn’t even know who I was, what my hobbies were, what I liked, disliked, had no friends, completely shell shocked.\n\n\nAnd because I still had to see him almost every day, it has been hard and i really thought I’d never be okay again. \n\n8 months later, I have realized I live a life that I want. I am learning things that I love doing. I dont ask permission to go places, I do things for me. If I want to go get fast food at 11pm? I’m in my car at 11:01 and I have the music playing loud. I dont wake up every day wondering what I can do today to keep his attention, and have the stress and anxiety of who he may be talking to on his phone in the bathroom. \n\nI have made friends, I have my own home, I do spontaneous activities with my kids, I eat breakfast for dinner, i let my kids make messes, I drag my bed into the living room and I laugh again. I don’t water myself down to keep anyone happy. \n\nThree days ago he dropped my son off to me and I noticed he was wearing a wedding ring. \n\nI spent a decade of my life with this man, raised a family with him, built a life together, and the first time I got to see him wearing a wedding ring, something I begged for…. was because he was wearing it for another woman he hasn’t been with for even a year.\n\n8 months ago, that probably would’ve shattered me. Completely wrecked me. But 3 days ago? It hurt. I won’t lie. It hit me like a weight of bricks coming down. But I remembered the life I was living then, the way I felt every day…. And I shook it off. Literally. Shook my head like I was erasing it from my thoughts. And I got into my car and told him have a good day. And I did exactly that.  \n\nIt does take time but I promise to every single person that is in pain right now, remind yourself of the most painful heartbreak/break up you’ve experienced  in your life……and during that time, you never thought things would be better again. Or you’d get through it and be happy. And then fast forward a year from that time. And look at how you wouldn’t be where you are today without that event happening. And know that it hurts now; but in a year from this moment you will look back and realize why it had to happen and yes the pain is almost unbearable, but you should feel excited because you just haven’t made it to the other side of that fast forward button yet.\n\nBelieve in the good things coming. \nI promise they are. \nHang in there.\n\nYou don’t realize what you’re capable of until you have no other choice. 💕', 'This was excellent.

Got into all kinds of trouble where she wanted to sleep with other guys as a couple. I agreed to it, as we talked about our fantasies. First issue was she sent me a screenshot of a message between her and a guy talking about having a threesome without asking me if it was okay! She already had him in her contacts and i didnt even quiestion it! Ended up doing stuff i wish we hadnt with other guys and i realise now what a total fucking idiot and weak fool i was. \nWasnt until the last threesome i went into a total meltdown that it was time to end it. I couldnt bring myself to call her, but text her that i had to accept we were different and move on. \nI unfollowed her on instsgram as i needed to really step away. \nTrouble is i couldn't.

I recently reconnected with someone I was deeply head over heels for as a 16 year old girl. We were only ever just good friends, but I always wanted more. He met someone shortly after, and ended up marrying her. We completely disappeared from each other's lives. He was married to her for 20 years and when they got divorced, it was a few years after that when he looked for me on social media. I was hesitant to accept his friend request at first because I was afraid for all of those old feelings to come rushing back. And assuming that it would yet again not be reciprocated. And yes, those feelings did come rushing back again which I predicted would happen. But this time was different because he started pursuing me immediately, which I did not expect. We don't live close by at the moment which is something we are trying to figure out. But that connection and that bond is still there.

He is definitely not the kind of guy to screw with a woman's heart and feelings. But at the same time I know there are other women out there interested in him, and all that does is exacerbate my insecurities. Even though he keeps telling me I have nothing to worry about. I really do want to believe in us, but it's really hard when you feel like you have to compete with women who are not disabled. And it's not that I don't believe him, it's just that I guess I feel like wow the one person I ever had real feelings for now suddenly feels the same way.

Sometimes they are socially accepted agendas (like two can live cheaper than one, or they want to have children), or worse agendas like for money or social status or family pressures or acceptance, or sometimes because of a lack of self-love and codependency. \n\nDid he EVER say or behave like someone deeply in love with her?? We don\'t know. She never said in her letter to Matthew. Maybe she never has had a man truly in love with her to know how that feels so she just ASSUMED the guy did because he was her ""boyfriend"" on paper - meaning they were together exclusively, attended events together, told people they were in an exclusive relationship, etc... but that doesn\'t mean anything. With more life/dating experience, you most definitely KNOW if someone truly loves you or not. You know in your gut. She may have ignored the signs he DIDN\'T love her for a long time.

He was very odd, always gaslighting me and used to leave the house every night around midnight leaving the doors of the mountain farmhouse open and to this day I have no idea where he went. With three babies feeling isolated, unprotected and vulnerable to attack was very stressful living in a remote area with no neighbours. Mathew is so right that when you leave it so late you are compelled to end up with some incompatible crazy man who were probably not meant to reproduce.  Egg Freezing is not a great solution either as you need to be young and energetic to physically and emotionally meet the needs of your children. I regret buying into the promise of seven years at university and twenty years career development. I feel now women are conned. My children are physically beautiful and in Talented streams in University now,  but I’m sure the stress of the home dynamic of their parents was very hard on them growing up.

I wasted 4 years in a relationship w/the wrong person & had to start over at the age of 38. I’m 40 now & still single. I tried to start this journey by having a fertility consultation & getting testing but both of the clinics I tried to talk to refused to give me an appt. b/c I did not have a partner & was not actively trying to get pregnant. I simply wanted test results & to know my options. My insurance co. only provides benefits to women who have been diagnosed w/infertility so if you’re single & would like to try to get pregnant you cannot get any services covered w/o having a partner & actively trying the natural way. When I found out the costs of egg freezing I gave up. This video gives me hope & has inspired me to try to start the process again.

So in terms of breaking up in the most ideally healthy way is to understand we haven’t done the work on ourselves to be capable of what true intimacy requires. Few people know how to be truly intimate, to truly care for the heart and needs of another. Most people use relationships as some mental projection of their own ego, and it has very little to do with who the other person really even is. Most people have little better than business deals, not actual intimacy. Most people have never known real intimacy.', ""Hey, we where in relationship from past 4 months he really cared for me and I yo really care for him but few days back I got to know something he lied to me and I understand his prospect why he had to lie to me about that.

So she did all the things she wanted in her own way at the end. And when she reminds me of my accomplishments (like going to university or currently writing a novel while being on my way to obtain a well-paid job), when she said she was so proud of me, it brought tears to my eyes. After that, for the first time of my life, my shoulders felt lighter and I discovered the first steps toward self-love and self-confidence. \n\nSo no matter if you feel like a late bloomer, it\'s not because your accomplishments or love life comes later in life that you\'re a failure to society. Just be you and try to be kind (only to those who deserve it please, do not be a doormat to those who don\'t deserve it). Life is not an olympic sprint, do not rush yourself into anything you don\'t even want in the first place and, if you want to slow down a bit just a moment to enjoy your current life or know yourself even better, just do it (in a responsible way please, do not bankrupt yourself or do something on a whim you would later regret). What you do in life may be one thing, how you do it is even more important. And if some people keep pressuring you to reach the same stage (whether love or accomplishments) as them when you do not feel ready yet or are not interested, it is YOUR life, your own exciting unique path, full of possibilities and decorated by your own special touch. \n\nAnyway, take care y\'all, and keep the peace and love (including inner peace and self-love) intact !!!', 'I’m 22 autistic kissed a girl but never been in a proper relationship', 'I feel so useless and zero-selfesteem cuz have no experinces.

It was not always so ….. we were very satisfied and continued to both love AND LIKE one another for many years. Now after 42 years of marriage we have found ourselves unhappy for several years. I’ve thought of leaving many times not knowing WHAT to do. Finally I realized that I was so furious at him for the quitting on us that he’s done I want to tell him where to go and move along myself. I know there is a spiritual solution to every problem and I know that MY work is an inside one. I was becoming so easily triggered I was so ready to RUN from this neglect I’m feeling. I recognized that if I ran out in the middle of these strong emotions I’d still be looking for Freedom in all the wrong places. I made a decision with and for myself. I’ve chosen to stay and complete my inside work . What IS it the unhelpful story around all of this that I’m telling myself regarding all of this? Why? Is it true? All the rest.

It’s been so incredibly difficult and so amazing to be learning so much both about myself AND my hubby. Who knows how I’ll decide when the time comes which I’m much closer to making now ……. I KNOW though that I’ll feel more comfortable that I’m making the right choice for the right reasons and that no matter the outcome……. IM already more confident and I already love and trust myself a bit more because I’ve gifted myself this uncomfortable opportunity. I can say for certain that whether we stay together or not, either way we will both feel more certain and better about ourselves and one another. I’ve come to appreciate a lot in my hubby of 42 years ( probably been together 50!) in the last year than ever before and it’s all brand new information that I’d never have known about the man otherwise.

I’m back and forth between 1 and 3. 😂', ""Thanks for the sincerity, the clarity in the way you convey your messages and the passion in sharing your truths - not many people can, or are willing to do that! 💫 \r\n\r\nThis past year has been extremely hard and challenging but also truly life-changing for me. Besides having to cope with the idea and consequences of an unprecedented world pandemic (like the rest of the globe population) I was also fighting my own personal demons: a serious, disabling illness, a chronic condition that doctors still can't fully identify. A terrifying experience but at the same time an eye-opening adventure that made me see life and the world through a completely different lens, and put things in the right perspective. Everything was suddenly clearer and I could easier distinguish the important things, the ones that really matter in life. \r\n\r\nThere were a bunch of lessons learned, I'm sharing some of them here in the form of advice, hoping they will help others:\r\n\r\n\t1. Value your health, don't take it for granted, it's one of the most important things you have \r\n\n\t2. Listen to your body, it's always sending messages on how to take care of yourself, don't ignore the signs\r\n\n\t3. Be in contact with your emotions, embrace them, understand them, allow them to teach you things. Be mindful, meditate, live in the moment\r\n\n\t4. Be kind, love and take care of yourself first in order to be able to be kind, love and take care of others\r\n\n\t5. When you feel tired and overwhelmed, give space and time to yourself when doing things - from the smallest stuff like house chores to the biggest things like making grand decisions\r\n\n\t6. There's power in asking for help when you need it, plus it makes the people you're asking the help from feel trusted and appreciated\r\n\n\t7. Show and tell your closed ones how much you love them. Be there for them. Take nothing and no-one for granted   \r\n\n\t8. During challenging periods like this one, people are in need of contact and support, especially the vulnerable groups. And even though we need to physically distance that doesn't mean we have to socially distance too: we can still reach out and help people: call, text, chat, see each other through videocalls, fund a good cause - all these technological means/wonders offer us infinite potentials for communication, let's use them wisely \r\n\n\t9. There's strength in unity - it's always safer and easier to go through hard times and fight battles as a team than individually. You can break one stick much easier than 100 sticks glued together \r\n\n\t10. Show understanding, empathy and compassion, everyone's carrying their own burden and fighting their own demons  \r\n\n\t11. Calmness and patience are great virtues: practise them the more you can, they'll come in handy when shit hits the fan\n\r\n\t12. It's incredible how periods of crisis can allow growth when we're open minded and have a positive, can-do attitude towards life.\n\r\nI do apologise for the long text but it is kinda all your fault: the video motivated me to gather and share my thoughts 😉\r\n\r\nA huge thank you for accompanying me with your videos during many difficult, sleepless nights and for the empowering and motivating words... and also for the right amount of ridiculously amusing, humorous, often sarcastic moments 😹\n\nBig love to Jameson (great job dude, the high quality in filming/editing levels up the game 🙃), hugs to monkey (cause every plush toy deserves a hug 🤗) and many thanks to the whole team behind the scenes! 👏🏼🙌🏽\r\n\nTake care of yourselves and each other, everyone.

Thank you for sharing your insight with women, in particular. It may be worth noting that black males could vote in the US before women could and that domestic violence is a growing but largely unacknowledged issue.. an often times deadly one. \nSpeaking of violence, I have been delivering Uber Eats for the past couple of months in Charlottesville, VA, which is one of the nations hottest beds of civil unrest. A few weeks ago, a black woman - at least 15 years younger than I - threatened to hit my vehicle and assault me in a restaurant parking lot.. simply because she didn't like where I was parked. I was not in anyone's way and was writing a 'thank you' note when she approached me. When she threatened to hit my car, I looked her in the eye, in a no nonsense way, and let her know that she would buy me another car if she destroyed my property. When she threatened to assault me in front of all the people standing around, I let her know that she would go to jail too. When she saw that I was not going to cow down, she left and in a very menacing tone assured me that she wouldn't go to jail. \nWith things as racially charged as they are, less than a week before the election, there is probably a 50/50 chance that she would face no penalty at all for criminal behavior that would devestate my livelihood. \nFor her sake and the sake of anyone else like her, who is being manipulated by irresponsible political leaders and news media, please be careful to address matters in a balanced way that promotes true peace and civility, which depend upon justice for all."", ""I watched this when it first came out and couldn't find the words to express what this means.

There's a plethora of layers surrounding the systematic shitstorm of a dog whistle we and our ancestors have had to endure for years and as you can see, still dealing with. What's even worse is having someone who looks like you in terms of skin color be intentionally oblivious and go along with the okie doke. All in all, I just want to personally thank you for having the courage to say something although there are many who disagree and see different. We are tired. I'm tired. However, when anyone uses their platform to speak up on painfully crippling injustices such as this, it does strengthen those who still have some fight left. Myself included.

I honestly don't believe if I act playful and coquettish, flirt and throw well-thought words to seduce a guy from the first conversation will do it. I am not that type of person. But it doesn't mean that I lack self-confidence! I am highly confident but too honest to put on such foolish, childish acts. I don't think I have to do something to attract the guy on the spot, like a kind of a clown or actress, just to beat down the competition. I believe I have so many qualities and it would seem to me pretty shallow to do things on purpose only to seduce the guy, I am not that type! I believe in mutual respect, friendship, which slowly develops into romance. This is who I am. I am more on the intellectual side: I open up a little slower, maybe in spite of my rough personality, I feel a bit shy to open up. Therefore I am more comfortable with discussions on different topics, like politics, social issues, and then, my way of impressing a guy would be writing poems, singing. So, what happens if I am not that expressive on the first meeting with a guy, does it mean in his eyes that I am boring or uninteresting or low-value, desperate, too easy, because I am the more serious type who doesn't display flirting and open interest? Am I doomed? Again, in my opinion it is so superficial to label a woman as boring or easy, only because she doesn't have the skills of impressing and wooing him from the first minutes. I am the type of impressing the guy slowly and opening up slowly. I am so sad that after the guy showed blatant interest, the next day when I walked up to him to say hello, he already took me for granted and acted bored. He left me hanging there. Even if he knows all my posts on facebook, my interesting articles, literary works, poems, songs with my voice, live broadcasts, even if he knows my value and intelligence, he acted like I was totally worthless and boring, only because I went to him out of respect, hoping we would hang out together and start talking. He acted bored and ignored me, waiting for me to leave him, like a stupid, easy woman. I am definitely not such a woman but he made me feel like that, because he is used to hot chicks who woo him and seduce him and flirt openly, put on shows for him, give him glances, sweet words, etc. So, my type of woman is doomed in these days, not to find a guy who takes his time and see that my value in fact is much higher than the fake seducing masks of the hot bimbos?"", 'These videos have been sooooo helpful.🙌🏽🙌🏽🙌🏽', ""Forget about how people see you.

High maintenance women are very ""draining"" of energy and resources. In which most guys nowadays don\'t have time of that. Which is why more and more women are finding themselves alone.', 'Higher maintenance? Are you kidding me? Worst advice for women ever. Women are already to much work. I have more fun with my male friends. Only thing men need women for now is sex.', 'I\'ve seen some of this guy\'s vids and agree with a lot of his points, but this is a dangerous trap he is leading women to. NOBODY likes high maintenance women, and hypergamy makes most women have sufficiently high standards to begin with. That doesn\'t mean settle for misery, but recognize society is constantly building up women and putting men down so you\'re most likely biased and think 80%-90% of men are ""beneath you."" It is the perception that female standards are unrealistic that have spawned a growing movement of men, including high value males, who just don\'t want to to deal with dating and women anymore. Men like Leonardo Dicaprio have avoided marriage for so long, and there are many power couples that ""should have"" worked out but didn\'t, and it\'s not by accident folks. The world is full of cat ladies who set their expectations too high. I have been a part of both sides of the dating guru industry for a long time and you have to be really careful because a lot of these coaches will say advice that makes you *feel* good regardless of whether or not it\'s true in order to sell more products. On the male side gurus will fill people\'s heads with garbage like the idea that you can say a routine and it\'ll get you *any* girl you want.\n\nGurus for females won\'t tell about the dark side where even high value men will fly overseas for cheap sex just to not have to deal with feminists or golddiggers of the West. In the future you most likely *will* be competing with sexbots. When the power of sexuality gets taken away from you, male tolerance for unreasonable behavior will plummet, and it is not going to be pretty. It\'s naive to think you can just pick these ""losers"" out from the crowd when in another video Matthew even explains how most women can\'t even figure out enough to avoid dating players. Aside from the obvious things you can do to increase physical attractiveness like losing weight, and using light makeup, and knowing how to dress and flirt in a sexy way there are a few other things that you can do that nobody ever talks about. They usually don\'t get brought up because most women don\'t want to do them and usually aren\'t required to if they are already at least mildly physically attractive. \n\nExamples include learning some hobbies/skills that are considered male(playing video games and not just casually on your phone), being direct in verbalizing exactly what you want without expecting him to read your mind(helps avoid false rape accusations), maturity AKA learning to control your emotions and accepting personal responsibility instead of blaming men(modern feminism isn\'t your friend), youthful playfulness and willingness to experiment in both sexual and non-sexual things(fun), acceptance/loyalty(ride or die) in the sense that if you see your man do something ""uncool"" or ""cringey"" you don\'t just book for the door.

How the WOW part comes in... is where you mention that this is your favorite thing that Elvis has said to you, and before I viewed this part of the video, I thought the same thing about your video presentation, Matthew. Do great minds really think alike? Check yes or no? I check ""yes"".\n\nWhat Elvis wants us to realize is that if we have some type of handicap, disability, or other thing holding us back, don\'t let this control us. We should thrive and continue our lives by growing, flourishing and moving toward our goals, despite circumstances we may have encountered. The 3 legged dog is still the same loving dog as before, despite the missing limb. A missing limb or handicap does not change the dog or a PERSON.

I would love to know your opinion on this if you don't mind?\n\nLet me give you the senerio. Say that there's this introvert, who's in a relationship with someone who's out going. \n\nNow these two have met and have gotten to know each other a bit and they have a clear understand of each other's lifestyles and ways of being. \n\nThey've discussed this in depth with each other their lifestyles, so they clearly understand very well where each other stands on this subject.\n\nNow the extrovert has been invited to something's, (parties, dinners, events, etc), now he wants the introvert to accompany him to these events, full well knowing how the introvert feels about such things, now there are problems in the relationship because this is not her thing.\n\nNow the thing with the introvert is that she just wants to live her life unrehearsed, and she wants no part of being pretentious, and unreal. So she decides to just be who she is authentically, without the staged performance(s) in/of life.\n\nNow Mr. Extrovert starts chasing her asking for a relationship, she keeps telling him no. He wants to know why, and she tells him that she's a lot of work to be in a relationship with, yet he keeps insisting on having a relationship with her. She still says no to a relationship but not because she doesn't want to be with him, but because she doesn't believe that he would not leave her when the hard stuff starts happening, because nobody ever has, but she tells him I don't advise this, but if you think you want me and can handle my craziness, then come get me. \n\nThat means, if you really think that you want me that much then you're gonna have to earn my trust by learning/showing me that your word is your bond, and by being TOTALLY honest, loyal, and present with me so that I'll know that you won't abandon me when my craziness comes out, because there's not enough time left in history for me to crash, burn, and recover again.

If you’re affected by rejection, you’re a narcissist? That’s wacko bananas. There is a very plausible scenario where a person is perpetually kind hearted, giving, empathic, and rejected repeatedly because most people are broken and operating on a wounded platform in love. Feeling the burn of that rejection, when you love so big, is not narcissism, it’s the inability to relate to those of whom do not love freely and easily as yourself. Most romantic counterparts are broken on some level, and not operating anywhere near the state of love that a kind, all loving, altruistic, empathic person loves.  If you’re rejected perpetually, you’re not a narcissist, you’re most likely a kind hearted lover, confused as to why so many people reject your giving heart. There are so many broken and wounded people, most of whom are accepting love based on their own background of being loved or unloved. Some men want the mean girl and they reject the loving girl because they cannot accept love. Love is scary for those of whom have never had it. The more love you have to give, the more difficult it will be for broken people to absorb your immense love, and most people are broken in some way, due to the conditioning of our lifetime. Don’t let anyone tell you you’re a narcissist simply because you are sensitive to the (sometimes overwhelming) lack of love in this world.', 'Thanks a lot Matthew.

And my ex girlfriend is my sister’s (A.K.A Kim’s) boyfriend (A.K.A Rony’s) sister. I’ve dated Rony’s sister (A.K.A My Ex) back in 2016. I didn’t really consider this an actual relationship only because we were young & naive at the time. But later down the line July 27th 2020, we had an upcoming trip to Atlantic City that required all of our friends to tag along with us.🏙️ So the day before this actual event itself, it was planned for everyone to sleep over so by tomorrow morning we just wake up & leave together. So at this point of time it was the sleep over day and slowly but surely all of our friends made their way, one-by-one. And throughout this time I was 16 years old, just getting back from work at taco bell. Once i made it back home i saw the 2 friends who made their way so far. But afterwards I just went to my room to hop on the game. At the time i was trying to become a twitch streamer by playing fortnite. I was doing pretty decent at streaming during the time so i really enjoyed it. So while i was streaming, more of my friends made their way, leaving only Rony to make his way. So while i was playing my game i received a phone call from my mom saying: “Can you come outside to help me and your dad to bring in the pizza?” I said: “Sure, i’m on my way.” As i make it outside to help my parents with the food, they open the trunk so i can grab the items and while i was doing that, the back door opened up and that caught my attention…. As i saw who stepped out, my heart immediately dropped to the ground… As we locked eye contact it came to my realization that my sister invited my EX to come with us to this event! So i greeted her “Hi” while she responds the same. After that short moment, I ran inside with the items and than instantly went into my room getting back on the game. At the time i wasn’t even playing the game, i was staring into the abyss of my thoughts that were saying “There’s no way she’s here right now…” but throughout time we eventually became a couple that lasted roughly almost 2 years…. We shared many laughs, amazing memories, and just really enjoyed one another’s company throughout our journey. But when we eventually broken up we both came to an agreement that it’ll be better off for our own personal growth journeys so we can become the best version of ourselves. Because during the relationship, now that i could look back at it, I was to needy and all of my time and focus was strictly driven onto my ex which led for us to detach from one another. And during the first 3 months of not being together I was really heart broken and struggling in all areas in life. I just felt that the world has turn its back on me. But during this “No contact” journey i was able to find myself again later on throughout this process. I started attending to the gym daily, made sure i had written goals that i can achieve, i started taking my craft serious when it came to making music, and i was really in tune to over achieve during this process. \n\nBut currently as of today: March 10th, Friday of 2023, I am 19 years old and it’s now been 9 months since the last time we’ve spoken with one another. But now since Kim (my sister) is pregnant she is hosting a gender reveal on April 29th, 2023 leading invitations to all friends and families from both sides of the family leading for me & my ex to meet again on this date. \n\nI’m not sure what to expect, i already know that things are gonna be awkward during this event, but my main goal is to actually enjoy my sisters gender reveal without anyone stressing about the situation with me and my ex. \n\nBut if i had to admit, I still do have feelings for my ex. I go to sleep and wake up everyday thinking about the situation that happened. But also at the same time i’m not expecting anything to happen. But the main reason why i’m looking forward for this event is only because this day will give me a definite answer if i should move on and finally let go of all attachment i have towards her or maybe there’s still some hope left in the tank.']"

Just add your name.  Then say to him"" please to not give this number to anyone else"" to assure him that he is an insider in your social circle and do not give out our number very often. That will almost guarantee a response.\nAn alternative is to suggest,  ""if we need to contact you, lets exchange numbers"", which works in a business environment.\nIt is a cultural thing....in the US in particular, asking for a number is a bold admission that they like you.

For the first six months our relationship it was just like pure heaven, we both never felt nothing even close to the connection that we shared and the relationship we started to build. I was so invested, and never did anything with the intention of hurting her. I was constantly showing her love and affection without holding anything back and i was trying to do everything i could so she could be happy, not because i was love bombing her or anything, i was doing this because i genuinely felt like that. And she was doing the same and sometimes with even more love and affection. But sadly as our love grew so did her insecurity and jealousy. I know that these are just my words and my side of the story, but i never gave her any reason to feel that way and our arguments were just obscure because i could not understand why was she doing that when i gave her no reason to do so. As time went on i tried to communicate to her that that kind of behaviour would just drive me away from her because it was becoming so complicated, so tiring, so unbearable, to constantly trying to make excuses and explain myself when i knew i did nothing wrong and gave her no reason to feel that way. The worst bit was that when things are good then it was the best feeling in the world, the good part of the connection and passion and amazing sex did not deteriorate even when the problems were becoming more frequent. But after months and months of thinking i could not hide from myself the fact that this relationship is just bad for me and that she will basically destroy me. Love is not enough, sadly. When i started to think about it i realised that whenever i tried to communicate in a normal manner any problem she would just either ignore me, or just start to hit back with arguments just to hurt me and insult me. She never tried to communicate our problems in a way that we can fix that, she just started to become defensive and aggressive. I realised that our relationship would basically be either her way or no way and i could stand that. If something nice happened in my life and something made me happy, she would be jealous for the simple fact that she was not the sole reason for my happiness. On the other hand i always tried be her support and to see her happy even though her happiness had nothing to with me, but i never found the same way of understanding from her side. Even though i still love her, and in a way i probably will forever love her i had to cut that poison from my life.

And this is the basis "" what God has yoked together let no man/woman put apart"" meaning ONLY  God holds the right to end a marriage In Malachi 2vs 16 Jehovah God has stated "" For I hate divorce."" This all means no matter what happens in your marriage not even the innocent party has the right to put apart what God has yoked together even  though the man has done such evil against her. Women initiate divorces most times and they end up being alone for the rest of their lives because they have done what God hates and they end up being the ones punished the most when they take into their hands what they have no right to do. Then because the man has not divorced his wife even though he is the cause of the problems that led to his wife ending the marriage, he gets away with it by being blessed with another woman whilst the woman lives alone to death. I always advise women do not return evil for evil because you never know that the evil you return , you could pay severely for it. Divorce is the worst evil than adultery because it destroys generations as well. Hence, these women suffer the most. Our grandparents stayed in their marriages even though they faced what we face today. Pray for your husband before you pray for yourself so God can help him with wisdom.

She immediately went into five months of chasing guys online, including one guy she decided she was gonna take away from his baby momma and move into her new house after only ""seeing"" him a week-and-a-half. The whole time she is being extremely intimate with her ex. The second the ex finally gives up trying to get her back and starts talking to a girl online she flips and talks about working things out, and eventually moves the ex in. He\'s there for almost three years trying to prove himself to her without being pushy. Last year she confessed she was talking to at least two guys online because according to her the ex hadn\'t been able to hold down a job, and she said she needed someone she could rely on to help support her and their children. Even though he had busted his ass to get and keep jobs and given her every cent she asked for, even though he needed the money to get back on his feet.\nRemember that.\nThen a few months ago she told him she had gotten interested in a FB friend she\'d had for years and was thinking about moving HIM in, even though he lives in Indiana and she\'d never met him in person.\nThen at the end of April an ex-coworker (They worked together at a convenience store in 2005, during which time he went to state jail because he passed out in the store parking lot with drugs on the car seat) hits her up online and sweet talks her and ""sweeps her off her feet"", and she throws herself all over him emotionally and physically the first week they\'re together, and just one month later they get engaged, despite the fact he ghosted her twice (once to try to rekindle a relationship with an ex-girlfriend - she was intimate with the ex that weekend - the other time for eight days), and despite the fact he had never met the children. A few days later she thinks she\'s pregnant, and the next weekend she decides she doesn\'t want to wait and they\'re going to go ahead and get married this past Saturday. A few days later ""they"" changed ""their"" minds. \nMeanwhile, the ex has had random people come up to him and ask ""Is your ex really seeing HIM??? She could do so much better!"" But one of his oldest friends is good friends with this guy, and has been filling him in on the truth about the guy, because he can\'t believe she\'s with this guy himself. The friend has told the ex that the guy is a lazy drunk who only works odd jobs for food and beer money. He says the guy told him that the woman, who just started a great, well-paying job in the medical field, has apparently told the guy she will work and pay the bills, and he can just sit around and drink, and she has even told him she will buy him a car. She hasn\'t even offered to buy her oldest child a car. Again, keep in mind she hasn\'t even introduced him to the boys, even though he\'s spent the night at her place twice, they\'re engaged, she\'s planning on moving him in soon, and she might be pregnant. And then the friend tells the ex that the guy walks around town looking for abandoned houses to break into so he can try to find stuff to steal that he can sell for money to buy meth.\nBy the way, she got her first paycheck Wednesday night, for about $2000, paid bills, got her toenails done the guy\'s favorite color, and took him out to dinner at the most expensive restaurant in town, and bought him some beard trimmers, but the ex, who\'s struggling, is having to buy medicine and food so the children have something to eat at her house, because she\'s too busy to go to the grocery store.\nI\'m trying to figure out what to tell the ex about how to handle this.

Finding excuses to “accidentally” touch half a dozen times or prolonging the convo or looking at me like “that.” Lol. We’re friends, associates. Been so for awhile. A month or so ago, we wound up on one of those friend “dates” that aren’t officially “dates.” Lol. And we had a blast and we sat in the car and talked half the wee hours of the morning away. Then I realized, oh, I’ve caught the feelings. Eek! Tortured myself for a couple of days about it and finally fessed up. I think it shocked him. So he never literally said oh I’ve got feelings too, but his actions said—yes I’ve got feelings too. So I just said I’m backing off. I’m not going to chase you around. Lol. So now he pops around again and I rather turned to jello again. So yeah, imma call him and just see how it goes from there. I have reason to believe that he wants to make sure I’m legit into him and that he may be just a tad intimidated. So anyways, I’m not going to just KEEP calling him, but I think I should just go ahead and “create” by just making this one bold move. And btw, nothing overtly physical has happened. We haven’t so much as held hands. He was always proper and quite the gentleman with me—well except for some of the juvenile “teasing.” Ha ha. Well, we’ll see I guess. The only real concern I have is that he won’t ever step up and take the lead or that I will be too proactive maybe. And I don’t want to be the forever “driver” of the relationship if anything happens. The main reason I think it intimidates him is that my father is his boss and he is worried what I’d think about him cuz he has Diabetes 1. But he’s well on his way up and has a solid work ethic and reputation around here with pretty much everyone. Anyone have any thoughts about this? Lol. Is this just a momentarily scared guy who needs a little nudge, or is this a guy who isn’t going to ever be man enough to lead? And I guess the answer would prob be that time will tell. I just don’t want to wind up getting too emotionally invested if it is the latter issue. Thanks to anyone who took the time with this long ass comment or whoever may have any insights.

Just as I was handing the item to my brother, I happened to grab eye contact with my crush. The way he looked at me was like “oh damn” written all over his face. It made this girl feel pretty good 😏.

I shared my plans and he shared his, and he left. \nA few weeks later... I discovered relationship coaching videos(unfortunately not Matt’s, because he is amazingly inspiring), after I moved into my new house with my bestie, around Christmas time. I watched them for a few months,  they gave me some green lights and some courage. So, one day after a half day of work, my co-workers and I decided to meet up at a bar for lunch, just down the street from my house. I made not such a great choice to have 6 mixed drinks before I left there. Granted I was pretty hilarious and got a ride home from one of my coworkers(A giant thank you to them!). After I got home, I was feeling pretty brave and decided to text my crush( whoa... mayday, mayday... Easy Tiger 🤭). He is a volunteer coordinator, and I asked him what the requirements were for becoming a volunteer at his place of work, because I wanted to figure out how to build more of a connection with him and I love to volunteer. My next comment was” You have a sexy booty.” His first response was...” I wish that you wouldn’t mention comments like that, I think of you more like a sister. I would want to jeopardize the relationship with your brother.” 🤦\u200d♀️😩!!!

Needless to say, I didn’t make it early in the morning. \nI didn’t talk to my crush for a couple of months. The next time I saw him, there was a different way that he acted around me, like he is interested. It made me feel really great to see his change of heart, but now I keep getting flashbacks of that day/triggered. For awhile I was even more shy around him, especially while his energy was coming towards me, because I didn’t feel safe, after I experienced what I feel as a traumatic experience. I am still trying to regain trust when it comes to my heart. I don’t normally enter the arena like that. He has been very patient with me to this day, as I heal my baggage from my last relationship and forgive that very painful experience.
